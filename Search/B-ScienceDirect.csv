Five categories of challenges that inhere in such collaborative work are identified and discussed: establishing common goals and agendas; resolving differences in terminology and structure; addressing issues of operationalization and measurement; dealing with insufficient transparency and the need for sharing information; and attending to issues of limited funding. We also offer some possible solutions for dealing with these challenges. These solutions are envisioned to contribute toward moving the field forward by supporting more scholarly collaborations in the future.";ID: 271765;;;;;;;;;;;0191-491X;;;;;;;;;https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0191491X21001188;https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0191491X21001188;https://doi.org/10.1016/j.stueduc.2021.101092;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;

The novelty of the approach stems from the generality of the jump structure we endow our model with, and the ability of the model to generate leverage effects out of the pure jump component. We derive the characteristic function and the forward characteristic function of the log-returns, which allow for the efficient pricing of vanilla and forward-start-like option contracts by Fourier transform methods. The proposed framework achieves robust calibration performance properties especially in the case of pure jump specifications. The results offered in this paper could have potentially interesting implications in terms of design of models and hedging strategies, and their development.;ID: 271700;;;;;;;;;;;0377-2217;;;;;;;;;https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S037722172100713X;https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S037722172100713X;https://doi.org/10.1016/j.ejor.2021.08.023;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;

So far, most of the discussions have been solely focused on technical developments, thus overlooking the complex array of socio-economic and policy factors. This paper aims to fill this gap by comprehensively analyzing MASS development. We develop and apply a novel model of technology adoption (TechAdo) to holistically assess MASS as an innovation. By triangulating data from elite interviews, with work at the IMO and a systematic literature search, we show that MASS is in development but still in its infancy. Our analyses show that factors in the enabling environment (social acceptance, regulation, and governance), along with human capital, have been overlooked and need to be carefully considered by future research and policy.;ID: 271794;;;;;;;;;;;0967-070X;;;;;;;;;https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0967070X21002705;https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0967070X21002705;https://doi.org/10.1016/j.tranpol.2021.09.005;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;

The dynamics of such risk factors under the risk-adjusted measure needed for valuation are derived. A sequence of reference probability measure changes is employed to obtain a compact and implementable price representations. We demonstrate how a change of numéraire approach facilitates the valuation of a GMAB rider in a variable annuity. A numerical illustration is presented to confirm the computational efficiency and accuracy of our proposed valuation methodology. In particular, our proposed approach on average takes only 0.07% of the computing time for the Monte-Carlo (MC) simulation technique to complete the valuation calculation. Furthermore, the standard errors of our approach's results are lower than those obtained from the MC-based computations. A sensitivity analysis is also performed with respect to various parameters. When there are no renewal options in a GMAB contract, we get the special case of a guaranteed minimum maturity benefit for which a closed-form valuation solution is established.;ID: 271685;;;;;;;;;;;0167-6687;;;;;;;;;https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0167668721001682;https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0167668721001682;https://doi.org/10.1016/j.insmatheco.2021.11.002;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
Journal Article;RefID:1067-cox2020implications;Cox,Louis Anthony;Implications of nonlinearity, confounding, and interactions for estimating exposure concentration-response functions in quantitative risk analysis;Environmental research;Environ.Res.;2020;;aug-20;187;;109638;;;Recent advances in understanding of biological mechanisms and adverse outcome pathways for many exposure-related diseases show that certain common mechanisms involve thresholds and nonlinearities in biological exposure concentration-response (C-R) functions. These range from ultrasensitive molecular switches in signaling pathways, to assembly and activation of inflammasomes, to rupture of lysosomes and pyroptosis of cells. Realistic dose-response modeling and risk analysis must confront the reality of nonlinear C-R functions. This paper reviews several challenges for traditional statistical regression modeling of C-R functions with thresholds and nonlinearities, together with methods for overcoming them. Statistically significantly positive exposure-response regression coefficients can arise from many non-causal sources such as model specification errors, incompletely controlled confounding, exposure estimation errors, attribution of interactions to factors, associations among explanatory variables, or coincident historical trends. If so, the unadjusted regression coefficients do not necessarily predict how or whether reducing exposure would reduce risk. We discuss statistical options for controlling for such threats, and advocate causal Bayesian networks and dynamic simulation models as potentially valuable complements to nonparametric regression modeling for assessing causally interpretable nonlinear C-R functions and understanding how time patterns of exposures affect risk. We conclude that these approaches are promising for extending the great advances made in statistical C-R modeling methods in recent decades to clarify how to design regulations that are more causally effective in protecting human health.;ID: 272394;;;;;;;;;;;0013-9351;;;;;;;;;https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0013935120305314;https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0013935120305314;https://doi.org/10.1016/j.envres.2020.109638;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;

This study proposes a new strategy for the extraction of hydrated mucilage using the surface response methodology (RSM) and polynomial equations for the optimization of the mucilage extraction by mechanical agitation (MA) and ultrasound-assisted extraction (UAE). The results of the solid:liquid extractions were fitted to a second-order polynomial model for the optimization; the evaluation of the experimental response variables included the yield, viscosity, thixotropy, flow behavior index, consistency coefficient, glass transition temperature, melting temperature, enthalpy and heat capacity. The predicted values of the viscosity, thixotropy, glass transition temperature and melting temperature were significantly different (p < 0.05). The optimal extraction conditions of the mucilage using MA and UAE included the solid:liquid ratios of 1:40 and 1:34.5 with 14.1 and 30 min agitation at 50 and 34.2 °C, respectively. The MA data were compared with the results of UAE and demonstrated that UAE improved certain properties of the mucilage obtained using the optimal extraction conditions proposed by the polynomial models.

As a result, alternative dielectric liquids meeting the demands for more reliable, safer, and cleaner energy has been a critical need. Plant-based insulating fluids, non-toxic to the environment and ultimately biodegradable, have been flowing into the mainstream for achieving cost efficiencies, performance advantages, and enhancing safety. With more than 20 years of field experience, plant-based oils are now employed in more than 600,000 transformers worldwide, and have been established an enviable performance track record. Far from being just a mineral oil replacement, but more significantly, plant-based oils have filled a gap in some specific application scenarios where mineral oils fail to satisfy the fire-safety and environmental standards. This article reviews the research status of plant-based insulating fluids for transformer, including both challenges and outlook circa 2020. Plant-based oils have many inherent advantages over mineral oil, but also have numerous and unique challenges.;ID: 271969;;;;;;;;;;;1364-0321;;;;;;;;;https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S1364032121000782;https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S1364032121000782;https://doi.org/10.1016/j.rser.2021.110783;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;

As new alternative jet fuels are introduced into the commercial market, it is imperative that fuel thermal stability is well known and understood. All fuels contain numerous compounds and additives that have an effect on fuel thermal stability. It is important to review fuel composition and the reactions that occur when exposed to oxygen, when heated, and also when blended with other fuels. Currently, the issue of thermal stability in fossil jet fuels and alternative jet fuels is a barrier to having blends of greater than 50% for commercial use. Different pathways and schemes to carbonaceous deposition are discussed along with results of current laboratory testing and historical research. Methods of testing and analysis of the thermal stability of different fuels and blends are also presented in this chapter.

Reservoir management consists of both the fluid production and reinjection of brine to the underground. The management of wells is important to ensure the sustainability of the reservoir. Thus, the flow rate control systems are essential to protect geothermal reservoirs under long-term power production. The second issue is the daily change in electricity prices and the load change process is complex because geothermal well controls are not flexible operations. The well management thus requires control approaches, and fuzzy control can be one effective solution. In this study, a fuzzy control system has been developed to control flow rates of the wells in Kızıldere geothermal field and its performance has been compared with the real data taken from the Kızıldere Power Plant. The results of comparison show that the fuzzy controllers achieved the target energy production in 2 h instead of 5 h, compared to the real data. Based on the real data, the reinjection was only able to stabilize at the end of the fourth hour and the process took only 2 h when using the fuzzy controllers.;ID: 271090;;;;;;;;;;;0360-5442;;;;;;;;;https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0360544220319241;https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0360544220319241;https://doi.org/10.1016/j.energy.2020.118817;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;

Financial markets are characterized by the so-called chaos model-data paradox, that is, it is relatively easy to design theoretical dynamic financial models that behave chaotically, but it is hard to find robust evidence of this kind of chaotic behaviour in real dataset. In fact, this paradox has been taken as an evidence that support the Efficient Market Hypothesis (EMH). In this paper we apply new robust computational methods based on statistical procedures to reconstruct the underlying attractor and to estimate the Lyapunov exponents based on the Jacobian neural nets. We have tested nonlinearity and chaos in some digital cryptocurrencies (Bitcoin, Ethereum, Ripple and Litecoin). The results show strong evidence against EMH supporting the hypothesis that those time series come from an underlying unknown generating process that behave nonlinear and chaotically. This fact points out that a potential explication to the chaos model-data paradox lies in the methods traditionally used in the literature which are not robust and do not have the capability to find chaos in financial time-series data.;ID: 272639;;;;;;;;;;;1007-5704;;;;;;;;;https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S1007570421002136;https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S1007570421002136;https://doi.org/10.1016/j.cnsns.2021.105901;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;

We describe: (i) the room temperatures achieved, (ii) the diurnal durations of heating use, and (iii) common diurnal patterns of heating behaviour. We investigate how these factors vary between weekdays and weekends, over the course of the year, by external temperature, and by room type. We compare these empirical findings with the simplifying assumptions about heating patterns found in the UK’s Standard Assessment Procedure (SAP), a widely-used building energy performance model. There are areas of concurrence and others of substantial difference with these model assumptions. Indoor achieved temperatures are substantially lower than SAP assumptions. The duration and timings of heating use vary substantially between homes and along lines of season and outdoor temperature, whereas the SAP model assumes no such variation. Little variation is found along the lines of weekday vs. weekend, whereas the SAP model assumes differences, or between living space and other rooms, consistent with the SAP. The results are relevant for those interested in how SAP assumptions regarding household heating behaviours and achieved indoor temperatures concur with empirical data.;ID: 271089;;;;;;;;;;;0378-7788;;;;;;;;;https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0378778821007933;https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0378778821007933;https://doi.org/10.1016/j.enbuild.2021.111509;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;

Because breakthrough data often follow an asymmetric pattern, the use of models that do not account for asymmetry could lead to poor fits, consequently resulting in erroneous estimates of breakthrough and exhaustion times. To address this issue, the Bohart-Adams, Thomas, and Yoon-Nelson models were modified by a logarithmic transformation to enhance their data fitting ability. The three modified models were found capable of providing robust fits to seven separate sets of previously reported asymmetric breakthrough data of water contaminants (fluoride, methylene blue, salicylic acid, lead, mercury, nickel, and arsenic), with reported residual root mean square error (RRMSE) values ranging from 0.019 to 0.046. In consequence, the new models were found capable of providing reliable estimates of breakthrough and exhaustion times corresponding to any predetermined concentration level. By contrast, the three original models were found to perform poorly, reporting inferior RRMSE values ranging from 0.038 to 0.086 for data fits and providing grossly inaccurate estimates of breakthrough and exhaustion times. The new models contain only parameters that appear in the original models, and are highly flexible, being able to assume virtually all monotonically increasing sigmoid shapes.

The application of complex network analysis(CNA) in EI research is conducive to realizing more secure, economic and sustainable distributed renewable energy supply and utilization in cities, and to realizing energy conservation, emission reduction and energy efficiency improvement in low-carbon cities. Based on the development history of EI, this paper introduces regional energy internet(REI) from two aspects of research scope and main characteristics. At the same time, based on reviewing the graph theory(GT) and CNA’s application in energy-related domain, it summarizes the particularity of coupling interconnection between transportation network and social network in REI. The concept of energy self-organization(ESO) and energy community(EC) is introduced based on self-organization theory, meanwhile, the differences and advantages between ESO and previous similar concepts are summarized and compared. On this basis, the key issues of REI are analyzed from the perspective of ECs, including complex network topology modeling, optimal network flow allocation, coordination and complementary control, cascade failure mechanism(the scale of different failures can be enlarged through interdependence) analysis and multi-agent interest interaction game. Meanwhile, main research challenges are summarized and the future work is prospected.

It is shown that iBIA provides considerable reduction of artefacts associated to array sidelobes leading to an improved dynamic range in the reconstructed mode distribution plots. The method also benefits from a data-dependent and fully automated regularisation procedure. Moreover, it allows to control the sparsity degree of the reconstructed modal content: thus different sparsity levels can be tailored for specific noise components, such as fan tones or broadband mode components. It also applies directly to the cross-spectral matrix of measurements, thus advantage can be taken of averaging the data over several snapshots whenever the assumption of stationarity and ergodicity holds. These features facilitate its application to industrially relevant configurations such as the UFFA fan test rig that was operated by AneCom AeroTest in order to deliver reference data for broadband noise modelling in the frame of the European Project TurboNoiseBB. The iBIA has been applied to perform a full azimuthal and radial mode detection as well as axial-wavenumber and azimuthal decompositions. Two configurations of fan/OGV-spacing along two working lines have been tested. The radiated noise has been measured by in-duct microphone arrays located at the intake and downstream of the fan module. Longer rotor–stator gaps are shown to reduce high frequency levels at approach conditions for both inlet and exhaust noise over a large frequency range. The benefit of long gaps tends to vanish for higher fan speeds and even leads to noise increase at high frequencies. Duct sound power estimates obtained from a full azimuthal and radial decomposition have been compared to estimates from both the wavenumber and the azimuthal decompositions, the latter two requiring further assumptions regarding the modal energy distribution. Based on this approach, the widely used equal energy per mode and equal energy density per mode assumptions have thus been evaluated on a large industrially relevant experimental data set.;ID: 272606;;;;;;;;;;;0022-460X;;;;;;;;;https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0022460X21006416;https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0022460X21006416;https://doi.org/10.1016/j.jsv.2021.116633;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;

Thermal comfort is a complex concern and the methods studied so far are only approximate. The first part of this review deals with the general description of the topic. This was followed by the classification of the literature published in the last fifty years based on the year of publication, methodologies adopted and comfort parameters studied. The main focus remained on a notable number of articles from recent years. In the following sections, the different factors responsible for the IEQ and its effects on the well-being and thermal comfort of the occupants are discussed. The next part deals with the evaluation of thermal comfort using various models and indices of thermal comfort described by the various literature. A range of IEQ-related issues, such as sick body syndrome, cold drafts, hot, and cold radiation are discussed. This study reviews the literature that signifies the importance of IEQ and factors that affect human thermal comfort. It documents how physical, psychological, personal, and environmental factors affect human thermal comfort, and efforts have been made to simplify a rather complex relationship between comfort parameters, occupant well-being, and IEQ.

Journal Article;RefID:1056-ozonder2021longitudinal;"Ozonder,Gozde;Miller,Eric J.";Longitudinal investigation of skeletal activity episode timing decisions – A copula approach;Journal of Choice Modelling;;2021;;sep-21;40;;100306;;;This study proposes a joint modelling approach to simulate episode timing decisions of skeletal activities -- activities that typically take precedence in the scheduling process -- using copulas. The analyses focus on examining the correlation between activity start time and duration while exploring the timing behaviour over a 20-year period between 1996 and 2016 in the Greater Toronto and Hamilton Area. For three types of agent classes (“Worker”, “Student”, “Both”), timing decisions associated with three skeletal activities are investigated: “Work”, “Work Business” and “School”. To obtain mutually exclusive homogeneous subsamples, further segmentation of agents is undertaken considering employment and/or student status, and occupation of the individuals. Parametric models are fitted independently to marginal start time and duration distributions using finite mixture models before estimating copula models for their joint distributions. In the “Worker” class, considerable stability is observed in “Work” activity timing models in all occupation sectors for full-time out-of-home employees, except for the “retail sales/service” sector. “Student” class agents’ “School” timing behaviour is also found to be stable in general for full-time students. More noise is observed in the timing behaviour of “Both” class agents. Given the correlation levels observed, it is concluded that start time and duration variables should be modelled jointly, not independently, within an agent-based, activity-based travel demand modelling framework. This paper demonstrates that it is possible to capture complex behaviour in timing decisions through parsimonious models that only utilize a small number of parameters and recommends exploiting behavioural information accrued over time while developing models.;ID: 286731;;;;;;;;;;;1755-5345;;;;;;;;;https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S1755534521000397;https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S1755534521000397;https://doi.org/10.1016/j.jocm.2021.100306;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;

OSM folding is enabled by introducing bending features along the bending line, named material discontinuity (MD). Firstly, the introduced analysis in this work developed a bending setup for OSM that does not require a die then introduced a method to analytically derive the bending force for a regular sheet without any added folding features. The analytical approach is followed using an experimental setup identical to the developed OSM bending configuration. Secondly, the OSM bending experiment is conducted to measure the required bending force and to identify which parameters influence the OSM bending force significantly. Finally, an empirical model is proposed considering the analytical force in the first step and the influencing parameters defined in the second step. Regression analysis is carried out using one portion of experimental force measurement to determine the coefficients of the proposed empirical model. The other measurement set is used to validate the prediction model. The validation results of the proposed prediction model show good agreement between the developed prediction model and the experiment results. The prediction model provided a shape factor that represents the topology of each bending feature, as well.;ID: 306234;;;;;;;;;;;2351-9789;;;;;;;;;https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S2351978920315158;https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S2351978920315158;https://doi.org/10.1016/j.promfg.2020.05.063;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;

The mineral oil (MO) together with paper is the main insulation constituents in oil-immersed transformers. To enhance the insulation level of ultra-high voltage (UHV) transformers and to decrease its weight and size, it is highly required to increase the insulating conduct of transformer oil (TO) and oil-impregnated cellulose. Lately, a distinctive novel venture of application of nanotechnology with liquid insulation of transformer has been conducted and the results have displayed marvelous enhancement in the insulation properties of transformer oil. The transformer oil-based nanofluids research domain (i.e., NFs) has been attracting huge attention during recent years both in theoretical and practical fields. NFs may be applied as a potential substitute for MO in the near future. To recognize various brunts of NFs and show evolving developments and challenges, the study demonstrates a scientometric review established on 210 published features from 2004 to 2019 through co-author, co-occurring and co-citation investigations. The significance of the editorial lies in compiling former inquiries, categorizing research nature, motivations and forecasting impending research orientations.

Resilience and vulnerability are representative indicators in the performance analysis of transportation systems. A large number of related studies have emerged in recent years. Therefore, this paper reviews the recent progress in the study of vulnerability and resilience. Specific definitions of resilience and vulnerability are first given from the perspective of transportation system’s supply and demand. Other related concepts of transportation system performance (TSP) are also discussed including reliability, robustness, survivability and risk. The existing studies can be divided into two aspects, i.e., the traditional topological structure and system structure analysis. The study of topology structure mainly revolves around graph theory, which is also the cornerstone of TSP research. In recent years, advances in data analysis and model simulation technology have led to an increasing number of studies considering the overall transportation system structure. The related metrics and research methods are carefully analyzed and summarized from qualitative and quantitative perspectives.

The framework consists of problem analysis, selection of value(s) as a background for the solution, the search for alternative ways of the solution, and the rationale for the solution. This framework reveals when, how, and why is important to think about values when solving problems. A consistent process fosters cohesive and creative value-based thinking during problem solving rather than teaching specific values. Therefore, the framework discloses the possibility for enabling the development of value-grounded problem solving capability.The application of this framework highlights the importance of responsibility for the chosen values that are the basis for the alternatives which determine actions. The 4W framework is meaningful for the people’s lives and their professional work. It is particularly important in the process of future professionals’ education.

However, traditional methods for selecting sustainable suppliers suffer from three main drawbacks: (i) Few existing studies have considered criteria weightings that have been determined both subjectively and objectively, reasonably and simultaneously. Moreover, among these limited studies, existing methods for combining weightings that have been calculated both subjectively and objectively provide only a poor degree of differentiation. (ii) Although MULTIMOORA method has high potential to solve the complex SSS problem, few researchers have given it much attention. (iii) The current Reference Point Approach within MULTIMOORA is not comprehensive as it only considers the distance between the alternative and the positive ideal point. Together, these drawbacks result in both inefficiency and ineffectiveness in SSS. This paper proposes a novel fuzzy MULTIMOORA-based method for SSS. The proposed method, firstly, obtains weights by both group Best Worst Method (subjective method) and fuzzy Shannon Entropy Method (objective method), respectively. Then the two types of weights are combined by Deviation Maximization method, reasonably and effectively. Finally, the paper introduces an improved fuzzy MULTIMOORA method to rank alternative suppliers, which considers both the minimum distance from the positive ideal point and the maximum distance from the negative ideal point. The practicability and effectiveness of the proposed method is verified in an illustrative application in Company L, a well-known international forklift truck manufacturer in China.;ID: 271506;;;;;;;;;;;0957-4174;;;;;;;;;https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0957417422000653;https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0957417422000653;https://doi.org/10.1016/j.eswa.2022.116567;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;

Non-residential environments have already been operating smart lighting systems for many years. These systems use advanced and integrated lighting technology, including an internet-based network for data communication. As user activities and behaviour in the residential sector significantly differ from the non-residential one; thus, a non-residential energy optimisation potential may not necessarily be achievable and directly translatable to the residential sector. Also, the architectural typological variety amongst residences may be larger than non-residences. In residential buildings, the effect of the composition of a household (domestic establishment) and user activities on smart lighting systems' consumption and efficiency are not explicitly investigated before. In this light simulation study in Sweden, the electric lighting energy consumption for a two-room apartment was modelled for three different household scenarios using DIALux Evo and DIVA-for Rhino. The household scenarios were composed based on input by 12 existing Swedish households and incorporate residential occupancy variety. The study’s findings suggested that the appropriate use of smart lighting solutions, including optimised sensor applications, has the potential to save more than 50% of electric lighting energy consumption compared to non-smart systems.

Understanding the travel mobility and demand of DBS become an urgent task for government and operators to provide better service. In this paper, we propose a network-based method to detect the travel mobility of DBS users based on the actual trip data. The studied area is divided by square grid with same size. The grids with trips are considered as nodes and the connections between nodes are considered as edges. To gain the dynamic characteristics of DBS travel mobility, we construct several networks according to different time periods in a weekday. We build a data-driven framework to analyze DBS network including accessibility, spatial inequality, spatial autocorrelation and network-based indicators. The relationship between flow strength and point-of-interest (POI) is discussed. The results show that travel demands of DBS are higher in morning peak and evening peak on weekdays. The DBS networks are inequality, connections are concentrated on center area. From the network view, the DBS network are assortative and positive autocorrelated with evident communities. The results imply that the number of residence and transport facility have strong correlations with flow strength.;ID: 271750;;;;;;;;;;;0959-6526;;;;;;;;;https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S095965262102148X;https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S095965262102148X;https://doi.org/10.1016/j.jclepro.2021.127930;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;

In addition to carbon capture and storage (CCS) technologies, there is a growing interest to explore CO2 utilisation. Several review papers exist in the literature either focusing on one or two CO2 transformation technologies or covering only experimental studies. This review paper addresses the gap by classifying CO2 transformation technologies and looking at products from CO2 conversion. It reviews experiment and modelling/simulation-based studies for CO2 biological and chemical conversion processes to assess their technical barriers. A detailed analysis of their technology readiness level, cost, market and environmental benefits are also elaborated. Finally, the research trend and projects for CO2 transformation technologies worldwide as well as the key challenges hindering their commercial deployments are carefully outlined. The analysis of the research trend shows a significant increase in research for CO2 utilisation with hydrogenation and electrochemical reduction being the most studied technologies since 2016. 53% of the projects are laboratory projects whereas, only 14% account for commercial projects. There is currently no commercial project for plasma catalysis, photochemical, electrochemical and non-photosynthetic technologies. The USA holds the highest number of 45 projects including 8, 6, 10 and 21 commercial, demonstration, pilot and laboratory projects, respectively.

We have attempted to deepen the conceptualisation of climate resilient development (CRD) or climate compatible development, while charting its pathways through fuzzy cognitive maps (FCMs)-based simulations aided by knowledge based on stakeholders’ insights. We conceptualise CRD as a development embracing mitigation, adaptation and inclusive sustainable development to advance planetary health and well-being for all. The FCMs-based simulations demonstrate that appropriate enabling conditions are critical to the achievement of CRD, the most important of them being (i) the ethics, values, and worldviews shaping CRD’s directions by framing appropriate climate narratives and action; (ii) partnerships and commitment to finance and technology by the governments; (iii) interactions between the actors and arenas ofengagement facilitating CRD decisions and actions; and (iv) dimensions of governance at multiple levels involving policy, institutions and practice.

Source areas are controlled by geomorphological, geological, or other geo-environmental factors and may largely influence the results of the modelling. In the Canary Islands, rockfalls are extremely common and pose a major threat to society, costing lives, disrupting infrastructure, and destroying livelihoods. In 2011, the volcanic event on the island of El Hierro triggered numerous rockfalls that affected strategic infrastructures, with a substantial impact on the local population. During the emergency, the efforts performed to map the source areas and to model the rockfalls in the considerably steep landscape characterising the island were not trivial. To better identify the rockfall source areas, we propose a probabilistic modelling framework that applies a combination of multiple statistical models using the source area locations mapped in the field as the dependent variable and a set of thematic data as independent variables. The models use as input morphometric parameters derived from the Digital Elevation Model and lithological data as an expression of the mechanical behaviour of the rocks. The analysis of different training and validation scenarios allowed us to test the model sensitivity to the input data, select the optimal model training configuration, and evaluate the model applicability outside the training areas. The final map obtained from the model for the entire island of El Hierro provides the probability of a given location being a potential source area and can be used as the input for rockfall runout simulation modelling.;ID: 271791;;;;;;;;;;;0169-555X;;;;;;;;;https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0169555X21000696;https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0169555X21000696;https://doi.org/10.1016/j.geomorph.2021.107661;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;

Using a deductive methodology on the literature covering the resilience of power systems, we reviewed more than two hundred peer-reviewed articles spanning the 2010–2019 decade. We find that there is vacuum on the level of integration that considers the interdependence of local or decentralized decision making in an adaptive power system. This gap is widened by the absence of policies to enhance resilience in power networks. While there is significant coverage and convergence of research on algorithms for solving the multi-objective problem in optimization routines, there are still uncharted territories on how to incorporate system degradation while designing these self-restoration systems.

Moreover, in areas with high humidity, the cementation of dust particles seems to be highly impacted by dew condensation on the front surface of solar panels. This impact can have a positive or negative effect depending on the climatic conditions and the surface properties. This review presents a critical investigation of studies regarding the effect of dew on soiling with a focus on the existing solutions to mitigate soiling by dew. Through this work, the papers have been studied and classified whether dew was the main topic of the paper or it is just mentioned as influencing factor on soiling. Furthermore, the dew effect was investigated whether it is experimentally found or just expected. Two kinds of solutions relying on either the enhancement of dew water or its mitigation have been highlighted in this review. About 61% of papers dealt with dew-soiling nexus have given a great interest to the enhancement of dew water formation ensuring solar panels self-cleaning, thus increasing their performance, while 39% of papers have recommended dew suppression. From a sustainability point of view, this work shows that instead of using conventional water resources that are limited, dew as a nonconventional water source may significantly be exploited to mitigate soiling losses in solar energy power plants.;ID: 282793;;;;;;;;;;;2213-1388;;;;;;;;;https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S2213138821007888;https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S2213138821007888;https://doi.org/10.1016/j.seta.2021.101774;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;

It is connected not only with the generation of harmful emission but also with the use of other associated resources. Energy efficiency in industry is one of the cleanest energy sources due to not generating energy. Current work proposes an approach for reducing primary energy use and harmful emissions at the oil refinery via thermodynamic analysis of process and energy streams and definition of an energy recovery potential. The proposed approach is based on the systematic reduction of energy consumption by an energy audit, a detailed process and units simulation, improved energy recovery and identifying the most reliable and economically viable process changes. It includes the heat and utility exchanger network analysis by grid diagram to find an energy gap and main drawbacks. The case study represents an application of the proposed method at the hydrocracking unit, where a considerable potential for energy efficiency was identified and utilised. The retrofit option was developed to show how debottlenecking and process changes contributes to overall operational efficiency. As a result, the energy consumption was cut by 54% and the economic efficiency of the proposed process changes confirmed by the discounted payback period of 9.5 months, excluding the time for the detailed design, equipment purchase, installation and start-up. Environmental results demonstrate the annual saving of 18,915 tons of carbon dioxide. Due to the slowing down of global economic growth, more attention should be paid to the modernisation of existing process plants.

Both, ‘Study Abroad Programs’ and ‘Internationalisation at Home’ (IaH) aim to provide a cultural immersion experience for students. However, explicit learning objectives are essential for quality pedagogy and for students to develop cultural safety from their learning experience. Objective To identify the learning objectives of study abroad and Internationalisation at Home (IaH) programs in higher education health profession programs. Design A scoping review was undertaken according to recommendations by the Joanna Briggs Institute (Peters et al., 2020) and PRISMA guidelines. Data sources The electronic databases CINAHL, MEDLINE, PsychINFO and PubMed and were searched in November 2019 and updated September 2020. The search was limited to qualitative studies, text and opinion pieces, English language, published between 2015 and 2019. Review methods Inclusion criteria using the participants, concept, and context (PCC framework) was utilised and search terms such as study abroad and Internationalisation at Home were combined with learning objectives to identify articles. The articles were screened for eligibility by title, abstract, and full text review by two independent reviewers. A data extraction tool was utilised to extract and synthesise data into categories that represent the core learning objectives of cultural immersion programs reviewed. Results Fourteen of the 66 initially identified studies were included in this scoping review. Qualitative synthesis yielded five broad categories of learning objectives used in cultural immersion programs: cultural competence, internationalisation, pedagogy, collegiality, and personal growth. Conclusion A minimum set of essential learning outcomes was derived from this review that will be of interest to developers and implementers of cultural immersion programs.;ID: 272471;;;;;;;;;;;0260-6917;;;;;;;;;https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0260691721000897;https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0260691721000897;https://doi.org/10.1016/j.nedt.2021.104832;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;

The mathematical model of adsorption beds was developed based on the separation mechanism and the interaction among different equipment. Moreover, a pilot-scale device has been constructed to verify the accuracy of mathematical model by experiment. The oxygen product conformed to the medical standard (>93% (vol)) with a recovery of over 57%.

H.;Learning presence within the Community of Inquiry framework: An alternative measurement survey for a four-factor model;The Internet and Higher Education;;2022;;January 2022;52;;100832;;;"Within the distance education community, the Community of Inquiry (COI) framework is widely accepted as a framework to understand and design text-based learning environments. The framework includes three components: Cognitive Presence, Teaching Presence, and Social Presence. Recent work has proposed the addition of a fourth component, Learning Presence, which reflects students' self-regulation, and its role within the original framework. This study evaluated alternative structures of the COI framework to explain student perceptions of learning online. The study participants (n = 256) were graduate students from multiple institutions who had taken at least one fully online course as part of their degree requirements. Survey data were collected using a single Likert-scaled survey instrument. Presented herein are the results of the first phase of a two-part study, which included a series of confirmatory factor analyses to evaluate the measurement models of the four COI constructs individually, followed by a model including all four constructs simultaneously. Future work on the second phase of the this two-part study evaluated a series of structural models using path analyses and hierarchical linear regression analyses. Findings indicated that teaching presence reached a more parimonious model with two subscales as opposed to the three subscales of the COI survey. A new subscale ""peer faciliation"" was proposed for teaching presence, but had better model fit as a subscale of social presence. The three existing subscales of social presence could also more parsimoniously represented with two subscales, with the new ""peer faciliation"" subscale acting as the third. Finally, learning presence was modeled with three subscales, and was the strongest overall predictor of cognitive presence, compared to teaching and social presence. This work makes unique contributions to the study of online learning environments through the COI framework by introducing a comprehensive survey that includes Learning Presence indicators, producing evidence on the multi-dimensionality of the COI constructs, and the strong relationship between Learning Presence and Cognitive Presence.";ID: 272103;;;;;;;;;;;1096-7516;;;;;;;;;https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S1096751621000415;https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S1096751621000415;https://doi.org/10.1016/j.iheduc.2021.100832;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;

For this we developed an integrated methodology that is based upon the reconstructed phase space theorem, the non-extensive statistical theory of Tsallis, ML techniques, and a technical index, integrating the generated information, which we introduce and named complexity factor (COFA). Our analysis revealed that the size distribution of the genomic regions within chromosomes are not random but follow patterns with characteristic features that have been seen through its complexity character, and it is part of the dynamics of the whole genome.

Ecosystem restoration as a natural based solution has been regarded as a useful means to recover ecosystems. The study provides a social cost-benefit analysis for a proposed project to restore the Dohrn Canyon cold water corals and the deep-sea ecosystem in the Bay of Naples, Italy. By incorporating ecosystem service benefits and uncertainties related to a complex natural-technological-social system surrounding restoration activities, the study demonstrated how to evaluate large-scale ecosystem restoration activities. The results indicate that an ecosystem restoration project can be economic (in terms of welfare improvement) even if the restoration costs are high. Our study shows the uncertainty associated with restoration success rate significantly affects the probability distribution of the expected net present values.

Latent multilevel modeling indicated favorable associations for teachers' self-efficacy, but not for their goals. In Study 2 (k = 96 teachers, n = 16,009 students), we assessed the same constructs and measured students' learning experiences weekly regarding 828 specific course sessions. Additionally, we included teachers’ session-specific motivations. Results replicated the effects of self-efficacy on the teacher-level and suggested that performance-approach and performance-avoidance goals primarily matter on the level of specific sessions.

They are able to make use of a large stock of user data and offer a range of services that otherwise were not possible. This move may pose fresh challenges to financial stability. This paper empirically evaluates the tail risk and systemic risk of technology firms. Our data sample consists of technology firms, and for comparison we also evaluate the tail risk and systemic risk of finance firms. We use daily equity returns data from 2 April 1992 to 31 December 2019 and we adopt the univariate extreme value theory (EVT) to determine equity tail risk. Our selection criteria is the market capitalisation and we choose the top twenty technology and the top twenty finance firms to evaluate tail risk and systemic risk. We found that the tail risk of technology firms is higher than the financial firms, whereas they are less likely to be in distress conditional upon a shock from the system. However, this finding for technology firms reverses when we use recent data via our six-year rolling estimates. We conclude that, similar to finance firms, there should be tighter regulations for technology firms since technology firms are riskier than the finance firms.

How to control its negative externalities while augmenting its positive roles in the urban socio-economic system poses challenges to urban planning and governance. Existing studies have insufficiently addressed the issue largely due to the lack of high-frequent observation data for street vending events. By introducing socially sensed big data from the smart urban governance platform, as well as records from the “12345” urban problem complaint hotline of Jiangbei District, Ningbo, China, this paper examines and compares the spatiotemporal patterns and occurrence mechanisms of street vending events from both the urban managers' “top-down” and the urban residents' “bottom-up” points of view. Statistical and machine learning models show that the distribution of street vending activities as sensed by the two subjects does not overlap. The former concentrates in central urban areas and work times, while the latter is scattered distributed in everyday life-related places and times. The findings reaffirm the existence of perception bias in social sensing data and show the potential for utilizing such bias to nudge better urban governance practices.

We propose a new control strategy based on calculated product column breakthrough from UV sensor signals by neglecting an impurity baseline and instead using the impurity to product ratio. This calculation is independent of the inlet feed concentration. In-silico simulation showed that the proposed method can calculate the product column breakthrough perfectly even with fluctuating and highly unstable inlet feed concentration during a loading cycle. Applying the proposed method to control a three column periodic counter current chromatography process with fluctuating inlet feed concentration resulted in constant column loading in each cycle, while using the standard method failed to do so. Unavoidable band broadening caused by diffusion and dispersion has been identified as an inherent limiting factor for accurate calculation of column breakthrough comparing inlet and outlet UV signals. The proposed advanced calculations increase the robustness of periodic counter current chromatography and extend the capability to process unstable inlet streams.;ID: 271409;;;;;;;;;;;0021-9673;;;;;;;;;https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0021967322000826;https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0021967322000826;https://doi.org/10.1016/j.chroma.2022.462884;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;

In this study, wavelet packet transform of forces signals was used to monitor the surface quality of CFRP subjected to conventional edge trimming. Conventional milling experiments were performed on unidirectional CFRP machined at differ fiber orientation angles - 0°, 45°, 90° and 135°. The feed rate was varied between 0.025 and 0.75 mm/tooth. Depending on the fiber orientation, the ten point average roughness Rz varied between 2.9 and 104.1 µm. A novel algorithm using Wavelet Packet Decomposition was proposed to identify the signal features that could effectively establish a correlation between signal features, process variables (feed and speed) and surface roughness Rz. A bank of 35 different mother wavelets with decomposition levels up to 10 was explored. Seven different features were calculated for the wavelet packets obtained upon decomposition. Optimal wavelet parameters were identified based on the regression statistics. Among others, two features – standard deviation and energy-entropy coefficient were identified as primary candidates which resulted in roughness prediction with R2>91%. In addition, the morphology and removal mechanisms of the machined surfaces was examined using scanning electron microscopy. The nexus between those surfaces and signals was established which corroborated the utility of the proposed algorithm.;ID: 306234;;;;;;;;;;;2351-9789;;;;;;;;;https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S2351978920315134;https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S2351978920315134;https://doi.org/10.1016/j.promfg.2020.05.061;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;

We consider a scenario involving an asset universe wherein some assets have sufficient historical return data for modelling as random variables, and others, listed relatively recently, lack historical data. The asset returns of such assets are modelled as uncertain variables. Thus, a hybrid environment involving both uncertain and random variables is considered. We use mean absolute semi-deviation as a risk measure and employ skewness (i.e., third moment) in the portfolio optimization model. The expressions for the mean absolute semi-deviation and skewness of an uncertain random variable have been derived. We show that the derivation of mean absolute semi-deviation is not based on any stipulation and thus is an accurate measure of risk (unlike the variance of an uncertain random variable, which uses stipulation). We propose a hybrid genetic algorithm as a solution methodology and provide empirical proofs to illustrate its advantages.

To solve this problem with high accuracy, we propose to use the common vector approach (CVA) that is a successful classifier when the number of data is insufficient. The feature vector required for the training and testing phases of the CVA is established by using both raw dissolved gas analysis data and some characteristics extracted from this data. The performance of the proposed method is evaluated over DGA data sets supplied from the Turkish Electricity Transmission Company and is compared with some conventional and intelligent methods in terms of classification accuracy and training/testing duration. The achieved results show that the proposed method exhibits superior performance than that of the other methods compared in the meaning of both diagnosis accuracy and computational time. Analysis performed on the physical faults, where the transformers fault types are verified with the electrical test methods, confirms the validity and reliability of the proposed method, as well.

It is urgent to develop communication approaches to reduce the misinformation's impact. This study aimed to test the effects of fact-checking labels for misinformation on attitudes toward vaccines. An online survey experiment with 1198 participants recruited from a U.S. national sample was conducted in 2018. Participants were randomly assigned to six conditions: misinformation control, or fact-checking label conditions attributed to algorithms, news media, health institutions, research universities, or fact-checking organizations. We analyzed differences in vaccine attitudes between the fact-checking label and control conditions. Further, we compared perceived expertise and trustworthiness of the five categories of fact-checking sources. Fact-checking labels attached to misinformation posts made vaccine attitudes more positive compared to the misinformation control condition (P = .003, Cohen's d= 0.21). Conspiracy ideation moderated the effect of the labels on vaccine attitudes (P = .02). Universities and health institutions were rated significantly higher on source expertise than other sources. Mediation analyses showed labels attributed to universities and health institutions indirectly resulted in more positive attitudes than other sources through perceived expertise. Exposure to fact-checking labels on misinformation can generate more positive attitudes toward vaccines in comparison to exposure to misinformation. Incorporating labels from trusted universities and health institutions on social media platforms is a promising direction for addressing the vaccine misinformation problem. This points to the necessity for closer collaboration between public health and research institutions and social media companies to join efforts in addressing the current misinformation threat.;ID: 272375;;;;;;;;;;;0091-7435;;;;;;;;;https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0091743520304394;https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0091743520304394;https://doi.org/10.1016/j.ypmed.2020.106408;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;

Testing for heterogeneous filing behaviors in the United States;Economic Modelling;Econ.Model.;2021;;dec-21;105;;105673;;;Consumer bankruptcy can serve as insurance against large financial shocks but may also provide an opportunity for deliberate use. This paper proposes and implements a model to test for the coexistence of heterogeneous filing behaviors in the bankruptcy decision. We identify two filing behaviors using data from the United States. One group can be associated with individuals who do not intend to deliberately use the bankruptcy law in the absence of an adverse event, while the second group is more consistent with a “strategic” behavior that exhibits a higher filing probability and financial benefit from filing.

F.";A novel microgrid support management system based on stochastic mixed-integer linear programming;Energy;;2021;;15 May 2021;223;;120030;;;This paper focuses on a support management system for the management and operation planning of a microgrid by the new electricity market agent, the microgrid aggregator. The aggregator performs the management of microturbines, wind and photovoltaic systems, energy storage, electric vehicles, and usage of energy aiming at having the best participation in the market. Nowadays, the electricity market participation entails making decisions aided by a support and information system, which is an important part of a microgrid support management system. The microgrid support management system developed in this paper has a formulation based on a stochastic mixed-integer linear programming problem that depends on knowledge of the stochastic processes that describe the uncertain parameters. A set of plausible scenarios computed by Kernel Density Estimation sets the characterization of the random variables. But as commonly happen, a scenario reduction is necessary to avoid the need to have significant computational requirements due to the high degree of uncertainty. The scenario reduction carried out is a two-tier procedure, following a K-means clustering technique and a fast backward scenario reduction method. The case studies reveal the performance of the microgrid and validate the methodology basis conceived for the microgrid support management system.;ID: 271090;;;;;;;;;;;0360-5442;;;;;;;;;https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0360544221002796;https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0360544221002796;https://doi.org/10.1016/j.energy.2021.120030;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;

Use of an Advance Directive Decision Aid for Patients with Heart Failure and Their Caregivers;Journal of cardiac failure;J.Card.Fail.;2020;;October 2020;26;10, Supplement;;S5;;"Background Heart failure (HF) is a costly, progressive, symptomatic, and deadly condition affecting more than 6 million people in the United States. Despite evidence that advance care planning (ACP), including completion of an advance directive (AD), enhances decision-making quality and patient experience, completion rates remain low. ACP decision aids have been shown to improve the quality of decisions in other chronic illnesses, yet few have been tested in the HF population. Purpose This pilot study was designed to test the feasibility and acceptability of an Advance Directive Decision Aid (ADDA) in hospitalized patients with HF and their designated caregivers. The secondary aim was to describe the levels of decisional conflict (DC) and decisional regret (DR) associated with participating in ACP discussions and consideration of completing an AD. Methods Convenience sampling was used to recruit 30 dyads (patients with HF and their designated caregivers) from an academic medical center. Feasibility was assessed by tracking the enrolled, ineligible, and refusal rates, in addition to the time to deliver the intervention. Acceptability was assessed via completion of a follow-up survey and participation in an exit interview. The dyads were evaluated for DC and DR following delivery of the ADDA. Results For enrolled patients, mean age was 56.5 years (SD = 12.17), 73% were Caucasian, most were male (66.6%), 54% were diagnosed with HF <1 year, and 70% were NYHA IV. Patients that were ineligible or refused participation were similar in sociodemographic data to the enrolled sample, though the refusal sample was significantly younger (56.5 years vs 49.47 years; p = 0.011). The ADDA took 2-5 minutes to complete. 80% of dyads found the ADDA to be acceptable and would recommend the ADDA to others. Dyads also reported that the ADDA assisted decision making to complete an AD. Dyads expressed similar amounts of DC; however, caregivers were found to have significantly more DR compared to patients (p = 0.008). In qualitative analysis, both patients and caregivers reported decreased anxiety and gratitude about ACP discussions. Enrolled patients expressed a sense of relief in participating in ACP discussions, though continued to endorse a sense of “impending death” if they completed an AD. Only 8 of 30 patients completed an AD at the conclusion of the study. Conclusions This pilot study revealed that the ADDA was feasible in clinical practice and acceptable to patients and caregivers. Younger patients were more likely to refuse the ADDA and caregiver regret was higher among caregivers than patients after viewing the ADDA. Patients remain fearful that completing an AD means death is imminent. Future research needs to be directed at breaking down the barrier to completing an AD and increasing completion rates, engaging the younger aged HF population, and understanding and decreasing caregiver regret.";ID: 272560;;;;;;;;;;;1071-9164;;;;;;;;;https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S1071916420309696;https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S1071916420309696;https://doi.org/10.1016/j.cardfail.2020.09.022;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;

Still, today CEPDHNs are often not operated in a coordinated way causing a lack of efficiency. This paper shows, how efficient resource allocation is achieved by determining the power exchange between both networks over an aggregated market. We introduce a welfare-optimizing, market-based operation for a CEPDHN that satisfies operational constraints and considers network losses. The objective is to integrate uniform pricing market-clearing and operational constraints into one approach, in order to obtain high incentive compatibility for the market participants while preventing high uplift costs from redispatch. For this, we use a hybrid market model mainly based on uniform marginal pricing and additionally utilize pay-as-bid pricing for a fraction of the allocated bids and offers. We perform a case study with a real CEPDHN to validate the functionality of the developed approach. The results show that our solution leads to efficient resource allocation while maintaining safe network operation and preventing uplift costs due to redispatch.;ID: 308669;;;;;;;;;;;2352-4677;;;;;;;;;https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S235246772100103X;https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S235246772100103X;https://doi.org/10.1016/j.segan.2021.100532;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;

Two channels appear to drive this finding. First, by giving boards more bargaining power to fight opportunistic bids, firms with more ATPs extract higher takeover premiums during market shocks. Second, having more ATPs attenuates the effect of market shocks on firm value by protecting relationship-specific investments with stakeholders from disruptive takeovers. Our results suggest that ATPs benefit shareholders during market shocks when firm values are abnormally low and represent one advantage of incorporating in states with more ATPs.;ID: 271671;;;;;;;;;;;0304-405X;;;;;;;;;https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0304405X21005377;https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0304405X21005377;https://doi.org/10.1016/j.jfineco.2021.12.009;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;

Reduction of carbon-related emissions has been identified as the common topic through reliance on the circular economy concept, taking into account the economic dimension in an attempt to decouple economic growth from emissions. Advanced control concepts, mathematical modelling and integration of renewable energy sources with carbon capture and storage and sewage sludge treatment can be recognised as dominant topics through the recognition that energy transition offers a solution to emission problem, but raises further challenges by introducing disbalance between supply and demand side of energy systems.

Discovering reasons and contexts for politicians’ tweets from news articles;Information Processing & Management;;2022;;May 2022;59;3;102892;;;"Politicians’ tweets can have important political and economic implications. However, limited context makes it hard for readers to instantly and precisely understand them, especially from a causal perspective. The triggers for these tweets may have been reported in news prior to the tweets, but simply finding similar news articles would not serve the purpose, given the following reasons. First, readers may only be interested in finding the reasons and contexts (we call causal backgrounds) for a certain part of a tweet. Intuitively, such content would be politically relevant and accord with public’s recent attention, which is not usually reflected within the context. Besides, the content should be human-readable, while the noisy and informal nature of tweets hinders regular Open Information Extraction systems. Second, similarity does not capture causality and the causality between tweet contents and news contents is beyond the scopes of causality extraction tools. Meanwhile, it will be non-trivial to construct a high-quality tweet-to-intent dataset. We propose the first end-to-end framework for discovering causal backgrounds of politicians’ tweets by: 1. Designing an Open IE system considering rule-free representations for tweets; 2. Introducing sources like Wikipedia linkage and edit history to identify focal contents; 3. Finding implicit causalities between different contexts using explicit causalities learned elsewhere. We curate a comprehensive dataset of interpretations from political journalists for 533 tweets from 5 US politicians. On average, we obtain the correct answers within top-2 recommendations.

Twelve decision-making factors affecting IOIS selection were identified and categorized under four significant dimensions: technological, operational, application, and innovative for effective decision-making.

In this paper, to enhance social enterprise sustainability, we propose a concept called “digital hybridity” to depict the phenomenon of deploying digital innovation to blend social welfare logics and commercial logics. Through conducting an in-depth case study, we observe how social enterprise sustainability is catalyzed by digital hybridity, and empirically provide a grounded process model, in which we elaborate on three mechanisms and their interactions for underpinning scaling both social impacts and financial incomes over time. Rather than focusing on individual capabilities and workforce composition to embrace tensions arising from hybridity, our evidence provides an alternative technological solution to accounts of sustainability in which digital innovation affords social enterprises the ability to blend the competing institutional logics that they embed internally.;ID: 271733;;;;;;;;;;;0040-1625;;;;;;;;;https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0040162521007915;https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0040162521007915;https://doi.org/10.1016/j.techfore.2021.121360;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;

The HAM considers brake blocks as rudimentary systems for emergency brake application to prevent catastrophic rail accidents under nonlinear and dynamic environmental conditions. A Gaussian mixture regression technique with a rational quadratic kernel function is used to develop a predictive wear model that applies wear measurement as training data. The Weibull feature estimates the threshold maintenance replacement strategy pertaining to other premature failure modes before the brake blocks’ legal scrapping wear limit is reached. Finally, the VOI feature establishes the net loss in terms of cost for the proposed replacement options to guide optimum component replacement selection strategy under organisational resource constraints.

The cost of the electrical energy demanded by the factory during the production can be greater than 20% of the overall cost. This kind of arc-furnace allows the production of steel with levels of scrap metal feedstock up to 100%. From an electrical point of view, the factory size in terms of its maximum apparent power demanded from the grid is designed to make use of the static capacity of the transmission line that supplies the energy. In that case, it is not possible to increase the power of the factory above the static rating by adding new facilites without installing new transmission infrastructures. This paper presents a methodology that allows an increase in net power of an arc-furnace factory without installing new transmission lines. The novelty of the proposed solution is based on a mix strategy that combines Demand-Side Management (DSM) methodologies and the use of ampacity techniques according IEEE 738 and CIGRE TB601. The application of DSM methodologies provides an improvement in the sustainability of not only the industrial customer but also in the overall grid. As a secondary effect, it reduces operational costs and the greenhouse gas emissions.

Journal Article;RefID:1001-meni̇z2021advanced;Meni̇z,Büşra;An advanced TOPSIS method with new fuzzy metric based on interval type-2 fuzzy sets;Expert Systems with Applications;Expert Syst.Appl.;2021;;30-dec-21;186;;115770;;;Decision-making techniques are among important topics applied in operations research. Multi-Criteria Decision-Making (MCDM) is one of the very commonly used subjects of this issue. Technique for Order Preference by Similarity to Ideal Solutions (TOPSIS) is among the most utilized MCDM approaches in terms of both convenience and efficiency. To provide the reality and ease of application of these methods as much as possible Interval Type-2 Fuzzy Numbers (IT2FN)s, a special kind of type-2 fuzzy sets (T2FS)s, are frequently used together with MCDM methods. However, before the final stage of the solution to the problem, defuzzification techniques are applied for obtaining the optimum solution. Switching to crisp numbers before the last step of the procedure reduces the effectiveness of using the IT2FNs. The aim of this paper is to contribute to the literature with a new idea of fuzzy metric function whose result is again a fuzzy number. The result of this study will be a serious contribution to the literature with its metric function structure that is a fuzzy number. A metric function whose result will be a fuzzy set can also be made for different fuzzy structures. Also, a new partial order relation will be given for IT2FNs to define this fuzzy metric function. Moreover, this new fuzzy metric will be adapted to the TOPSIS method. Hence, it will be assured that the defuzzification operations are used only in the final sorting stage and the advantage of using fuzzy numbers will be able to continue in further steps. The advanced TOPSIS with a new fuzzy metric will be applied to a video chat program selection problem as an example.;ID: 271506;;;;;;;;;;;0957-4174;;;;;;;;;https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0957417421011416;https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0957417421011416;https://doi.org/10.1016/j.eswa.2021.115770;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;

Technology innovation, demand-side management, and system transition have been promoted to meet these needs while reducing negative impacts on the environment and public health. This special issue on “Energy Demand for Residential Space Heating: History and Outlook” improves our understanding of energy consumption for space heating. The purpose of this introductory article is to present research advances by summarizing recent literature as well as new findings and insights from this special issue. This research shows that heating energy systems show increasing disparity due to various local resources, building characteristics, climatic conditions, technology adoption, and economic status. Thus, more advanced algorithms and more detailed classification of these factors can more accurately measure and predict the energy demand for space heating. The goal of heating energy systems is to reduce energy consumption and carbon emissions without sacrificing thermal comfort. Most research focuses on how technology innovation, demand-side management strategies, or public policies can help achieve this goal. Current findings suggest that a comprehensive evaluation, considering technological feasibility, economic affordability, and environmental sustainability, is needed to promote the sustainable transition of heating energy systems.;ID: 271089;;;;;;;;;;;0378-7788;;;;;;;;;https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0378778822001360;https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0378778822001360;https://doi.org/10.1016/j.enbuild.2022.111965;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;

In the SC game, the manufacturer sets the production rate and replenishes the inventory at the retailer’s store. The retailer sets the price, which affects both the sales and the inventory. Firms share the revenues and the inventory costs through a sharing agreement. The inventory dynamics increase in the production rate, decrease in the sales and vary according to some stochastic and time-independent error terms. The adoption of a smart application allows the SC to remove these error terms. Nevertheless, the consulting company implementing the intelligent system charges fees that depend on the error term amplitude and inventory level. Furthermore, intelligent solutions allow the SC to better satisfy the consumers, although their impact on production and emissions may be detrimental questioning whether they lead to a responsible digitalization. We identify the conditions under which the adoption of a smart system is economically beneficial for the whole SC as well as its operational, environmental, and SC coordination implications.;ID: 271700;;;;;;;;;;;0377-2217;;;;;;;;;https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0377221720309401;https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0377221720309401;https://doi.org/10.1016/j.ejor.2020.10.049;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;

Many black-box approaches have been proposed to automatically predict the veracity of claims. These methods are lack of interpretability. Thus, we propose a Quantitative Argumentation-based Automated eXplainable Decision-making System (QA-AXDS) to tackle this problem and provide users with explanations about the results. The system is fully data-driven in its processes, which allows our models to make greater use of data and be more automatic and scalable than other quantitative framework models. In terms of interpretability, the system can automatically acquire human-level knowledge, and interact with users in the form of dialog trees through explanatory models, thus helping them understand the internal reasoning process of the system. The experimental results show that our system has better transparency and interpretability than other approaches based on the pure machine learning methods, and performs competitively in accuracy among others. In addition, the explanation model provides a way to improve the algorithms when some problems are identified by checking the explanations.;ID: 271505;;;;;;;;;;;0950-7051;;;;;;;;;https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0950705122001447;https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0950705122001447;https://doi.org/10.1016/j.knosys.2022.108378;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;

However, there seems to be a notable research gap regarding the charging power limitations of the on-board chargers of the EVs. In this paper, the present state of the maximum charging powers of the on-board chargers is thoroughly analysed using data from two commercial charging sites. Furthermore, the results of the analysis are used along with an EV fleet development model to form realistic future scenarios, which are then used for a simulation model that couples the charging sessions with measured charging profiles. The results of the simulations show that, due to the evolution of the EV fleet, the average energy consumption in commercial locations will increase by 134% on average from 5.6 to 8.7 kWh/EV to 13.0–19.6 kWh/EV during 2020–2040. Similarly, the peak of the normalized power increases by 77% on average from 1.1 to 1.4 kW/EV to 1.6–2.9 kW/EV.

Understanding resilience dynamics for these ageing wastewater assets represents a fundamental step in classifying multi-dimensional water stressors toward preventing severe pollution incidents. This paper explores the potential of a novel dynamic resilience approach to assess and predict the dynamic resilience of biological wastewater treatment based on the separation of stressor events (cause) and process stress (effect) to consider the deviation from reference conditions. The approach presented provides a fundamental link between (1) conventional activated sludge modelling methodologies, (2) actual biological wastewater process instrument data (potential for knowledge discovery) and (3) the characterisation of dynamic resilience in wastewater treatment processes. Results first present the dynamic resilience approach by modelling simulated shock flow conditions on an activated sludge plant, then incorporates ten years of wastewater process instrument data to demonstrate the actual dynamic resilience. The aim is to represent the “dynamic resilience” as self-ordering windows, a visual knowledge base (three dimensional, heat map), which operational staff can easily interpret. The outcomes presented suggest that such an approach is feasible and has the potential for real-time identification of conditions that result in pollution incidents based on actual historical process instrument data (knowledge discovery). Also, the methods presented could be extended to develop an improved understanding of wastewater system resilience under a range of future stressor scenarios.;ID: 305753;;;;;;;;;;;2214-7144;;;;;;;;;https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S2214714421002579;https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S2214714421002579;https://doi.org/10.1016/j.jwpe.2021.102170;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;

However, the transition away from gasoline is often hindered by the inability of currently operating vehicles to efficiently run under alternative fuels. Therefore, the logical short-term alternative is to transition to clean fuel sources including higher-ethanol fuel blends that are compatible with current fuel systems and spark-ignition engines. In this work, the long-term adaptability and economic feasibility of non-flex vehicles to consume a 30% ethanol (E30) fuel blend was investigated. Sixteen diagnostic and operating parameters were tracked in real-time in 50 vehicles over a one-year period. The vast amount of data generated was used to train sparse regression and machine learning models to explore differences in performance and operational robustness of commercial vehicles consuming E30 blends compared to the ones consuming 15% blends. Results indicate that although modest changes can be observed in the behavior of a subset of parameters, overall performance and adaptability are not compromised by consumption of E30. It was determined that an average price difference of 2.5% is sufficient to offset the mileage loss caused by the increased ethanol concentration.Finally, we discuss the large-scale environmental impact of an incremental nation-wide shift towards E30 consumption.;ID: 271496;;;;;;;;;;;0016-2361;;;;;;;;;https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0016236121015106;https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0016236121015106;https://doi.org/10.1016/j.fuel.2021.121629;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;

They cannot reflect the characteristics of a traffic flow system changing with time, resulting in their poor adaptability. Firstly, the viscoelastic traffic flow model is simplified. The fractional viscoelastic traffic flow model is established in combination with modelling principle of the Bass model and successful application of fractional calculus in viscoelastic fluid. Conformable fractional derivative and the fractional grey model are then introduced to establish a fractional grey viscoelastic traffic flow model that can reflect time-varying characteristics. Finally, the new model is compared with traditional statistical models in terms of model efficiency and stability and is applied to the modelling of traffic flow and traffic congestion level in multiple scenarios. The modelling results are compared with six other models. Results show that the new model has better stability and modelling effect.;ID: 271728;;;;;;;;;;;0191-2615;;;;;;;;;https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0191261522000194;https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0191261522000194;https://doi.org/10.1016/j.trb.2022.01.007;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;

Our solid analysis shows that the maximum daily working time for a taxi driver is suggested to be less than 10 h for safety concerns because it could reduce the possible taxi crashes. In addition, the likelihood of taxi crashes in the daylight is the highest when compared to road conditions with streetlights or one without streetlights at all.

To support informed, data-driven model updating strategies, we present and evaluate a calibration drift detection system. Methods are developed for maintaining dynamic calibration curves with optimized online stochastic gradient descent and for detecting increasing miscalibration with adaptive sliding windows. These methods are generalizable to support diverse prediction models developed using a variety of learning algorithms and customizable to address the unique needs of clinical use cases. In both simulation and case studies, our system accurately detected calibration drift. When drift is detected, our system further provides actionable alerts by including information on a window of recent data that may be appropriate for model updating. Simulations showed these windows were primarily composed of data accruing after drift onset, supporting the potential utility of the windows for model updating. By promoting model updating as calibration deteriorates rather than on pre-determined schedules, implementations of our drift detection system may minimize interim periods of insufficient model accuracy and focus analytic resources on those models most in need of attention.;ID: 272371;;;;;;;;;;;1532-0464;;;;;;;;;https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S1532046420302392;https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S1532046420302392;https://doi.org/10.1016/j.jbi.2020.103611;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;

However, there is significant regional and seasonal variability, and significant changes in seasonal cycle amplitudes have been predicted. Three decades of sea surface observations collected from the southeast Florida Current and shelf waters reveal behavior over seasonal and interannual timescales for a region important to global carbon storage and transport. The strong temperature dependence of fCO2 in the region dominates the seasonal cycle of air-sea flux, although biophysical processes are also important. The possibility of wet and dry seasonal asymmetric trends through time were evaluated, but no statistically significant trends were found. The results indicate that uptake in the region has not changed over the last three decades after accounting for sampling bias and demonstrate the importance of robust seasonally unbiased data sets in conducting climate studies. Even in this highly sampled region, data distribution biases were found, mainly in the early 1990s. Seasonally biased data are thus not only a problem for polar regions but can also affect flux calculations in sub-tropical regions. Although not statistically significant to date, different responses in different seasons with time may lead to seasonal amplification and a decoupling of the annual mean and the seasonal means in the future.;ID: 271732;;;;;;;;;;;0278-4343;;;;;;;;;https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0278434321002223;https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0278434321002223;https://doi.org/10.1016/j.csr.2021.104566;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;

We propose a hybrid state-of-charge (SOC) battery model with aggregator to optimize battery charging and maintain grid stability during peak periods. The proposed SOC model leverages the advantages of three well-known previously proposed battery models namely: Shepherd, Unnewehr and Nernst models. The proposed hybrid model is a combination of the merits of the three specified empirical Lithium-ion battery models to optimize slow charging. This will enhance battery performance by improving its depth-of-discharge profile. This results in enhanced V2G capability and longer driving time for EV owners. Battery parameters used in the simulation are for Nissan Leaf 2019 EV. The proposed SOC model parameters are used to optimize a two-objective function which is used by the aggregator to maximize benefits to both EV owners and DSO. Multi-objective genetic algorithm (MOGA) is used to optimize the objective function because of its ability to obtain non-dominated solutions while still maintaining diversity of the solutions. From simulation results, proposed OCV model improves battery SOC by 10% after V2G operating period (2 p.m.) compared to a case without the model. Also, proposed model earns aggregator $445 and $45 more for voltage and frequency regulation services, respectively.

Several lines of evidence suggest that glioblastoma multiforme has a genetic basis. A genetic test that could identify people who are at high risk of developing glioblastoma multiforme could improve our understanding of this form of brain cancer. Using the Cancer Genome Atlas (TCGA) dataset, we found common germ line DNA copy number variations in the TCGA population. We tested whether different sets of these germ line DNA copy number variations could effectively distinguish patients with glioblastoma multiforme from others in the TCGA dataset. We used a gradient boosting machine, a machine learning classification algorithm, to classify TCGA patients solely based on a set of germline DNA copy number variations. We found that this machine learning algorithm could classify TCGA glioblastoma multiforme patients from the other TCGA patients with an area under the curve (AUC) of the receiver operating characteristic curve (AUC=0.875). Grouped into quintiles, the highest ranked quintile by the machine learning algorithm had an odds ratio of 3.78 (95% CI 3.25–4.40) higher than the average odds ratio and about 40 (95% CI 20–70) times higher than the lowest quintile. The identification of an effective germ line genetic test to stratify risk of developing glioblastoma multiforme should lead to a better understanding of how this cancer forms.

This paper established a 50% positive switching impulse breakdown voltage prediction model based on the cuckoo search algorithm optimized support vector regression for the rod-plane air gap. This calculation model is used to predict the selected prediction data. The predicted results are basically consistent with the experimental results, and the effect is better than the atmospheric correction results. Finally, the method was used to calculate the 50% positive impulse breakdown voltage of the rod-plane air gap under the extreme temperature and humidity conditions in Beijing. This method provides a new idea for obtaining the air gap breakdown voltage under different atmospheric conditions.;ID: 271091;;;;;;;;;;;0378-7796;;;;;;;;;https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0378779620303229;https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0378779620303229;https://doi.org/10.1016/j.epsr.2020.106518;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;

Urban Building Energy Models (UBEMs) are promising tools to simulate the energy demand of buildings under different urban scenarios. Nowadays, the major barriers to the effective use of UBEMs are the uncertainty related to their input parameters and the lack of good-quality, open energy consumption data. The latter make deterministic UBEM simulations unreliable, and calibration approaches unsuitable for most cities in the world. The present work proposes to combine physics-based UBEMs with Uncertainty and Sensitivity Analysis on the main input parameters using aggregated data on energy use from regional/national statistics. The proposed procedure selects the most influential input parameters and characterizes their uncertainty through Forward Uncertainty Analysis and Sensitivity Analysis to obtain stochastic load profiles for space heating and cooling. The method was first tested against hourly thermal power profiles metered on a heterogeneous sample of buildings in Verona (Italy). The average heating load profile obtained is significantly improved compared to deterministic, archetype-based simulations in terms of energy needs and peak loads. The overestimation of residential buildings peak load is reduced from 80% to 25%, and the deviation in the energy needs calculation drops from 18% to 10%. The proposed simulation procedure was then applied to a district of Milan (Italy), including more than 600 buildings, resulting in similar variations. Overall, the results demonstrate that considering the uncertainty of operational, geometrical and physical parameters is of the utmost importance to obtain reliable urban simulations.;ID: 271429;;;;;;;;;;;0306-2619;;;;;;;;;https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0306261922001568;https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0306261922001568;https://doi.org/10.1016/j.apenergy.2022.118691;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;

Performing demand curtailment will psychologically disturb end-customers' comfort and affect decision-making. The penetration of battery energy storage systems (BESSs) in electricity grids introduces another response resource to the grid operator (GO). Therefore, it's important to investigate the effect of different customer psychological factors (CPFs) on incentive-based demand response (IBDR) strategy in the system with diversified response resources including BESSs. Behavioral economics (BE) interprets individual behavior from psychology and provides insights to behavior modeling. Therefore, this paper applied BE to incorporate CPFs, such as the endowment effect and time-discounting effect. Furthermore, to bring the value of CPFs to the system level, an IBDR model considering CPFs and BESSs (CE-IBDR) is proposed by following the Stackelberg game theory. Upon the participation of load aggregators (LAs) and BESSs operator (EO) in IBDR, the model extends two-party hierarchical levels to four-party spinning from the GO, EOs, LAs and end-customers by extending the two-party Stackelberg game to a two-loop Stackelberg game. Results show that without incorporating CPFs into the model will result deviation in interpreting customer behavior. BESSs is preferred reponse resource than load reduction due to the pressure to incentive end-customers with high endowment valuation.;ID: 271090;;;;;;;;;;;0360-5442;;;;;;;;;https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0360544221024403;https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0360544221024403;https://doi.org/10.1016/j.energy.2021.122192;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;

With most of the participants coming from academia, and a few from the professional field, ICEER series is still growing and attracting increased interest. Energy production, distribution and use are fundamental for the Sustainable Development of nations, showing a clear link between the energy and environment issues. Nevertheless, these matters are frequently dealt with separately, reflecting the way they are taught, and causing strong negative impacts, and hindering progress. With a growing trend in circular economy models applied to common goods production and commercialization, ICEER 2019 had as focus theme the challenges posed by energy and environment research in a circular economy-based model. This paper presents the main achievements and conclusions of ICEER 2019 participants, through their research in the fields of energy and environment, including a brief analysis of the current requirements of Education on Sustainable Development applied to the modern technological curricula.;ID: 311225;;;;;;;;;;;2352-4847;;;;;;;;;https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S2352484720302067;https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S2352484720302067;https://doi.org/10.1016/j.egyr.2020.02.008;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;

Identifying where mariculture production occurs remains a major challenge for understanding its environmental impacts and the sustainability of individual farms and the sector as a whole. We compiled known mariculture locations and applied a simple production-allocation approach to map remaining global mariculture locations across 73 countries using the key determinants of distance to shore and ports, and average productivity (tonnage) of known farms. Our map represents 96% of reported fish and invertebrate mariculture production for 2017, but excludes algae which constitutes half of global mariculture production. We provide, for the first time, a publicly available spatial database of known and estimated mariculture locations. We discuss the utility and limitations of the existing data and our modeling approach, and highlight the key data gaps and future challenges for mapping aquaculture. Our results provide a vital resource for mariculture and environmental researchers, but we emphasize the need for a standardized, ground-truthed global spatial database of aquaculture locations and farm-level attributes (e.g., species, production type) to better understand the distribution of production and adequately plan for future growth.;ID: 271224;;;;;;;;;;;0044-8486;;;;;;;;;https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S004484862200182X;https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S004484862200182X;https://doi.org/10.1016/j.aquaculture.2022.738066;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;

Establishing its effectiveness is sometimes elusive, however, as market participation and behaviour can be confounded by many special circumstances, especially in energy. We develop an unusual model-based approach in order to establish if a market-making intervention improved the fundamental price formation dynamics. In the context of the Japanese wholesale electricity auction, we develop a dynamic regime switching formulation to account for the distinct effects of buy-side and sell-side volumes on price formation, using temperature as a regime switching driver. The model has a nonlinear functionality that allows it to fit the spiky time series very effectively. The result is clarity that after a market-making intervention in 2017, the buy and sell volumes had more intuitive and distinct effects upon price formation, compared to previously. In addition, temperature information has been more coherently embedded in price and volatility fundamental modelling since the intervention. We argue that the model indicated a more balanced market with buy and sell side regime drivers behaving more consistently with improved market efficiency.;ID: 271683;;;;;;;;;;;0140-9883;;;;;;;;;https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0140988321006071;https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0140988321006071;https://doi.org/10.1016/j.eneco.2021.105765;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;

The higher performances of the artificial intelligence (AI)-based techniques than classical regression-based models were proved in the sediment-transport modeling. One of the well-known AI-based methods is the adaptive neuro-fuzzy inference system (ANFIS). The main issues that should be considered in ANFIS are optimization of the linear consequent parameters and nonlinear antecedent parameters. To do that the individual ANFIS applied a hybrid algorithm (a combination of the backpropagation and least-square algorithms). To enhance the predictive performance of the ANFIS, the evolutionary algorithms, including differential evolution (DE) and genetic algorithm (GA) (ANFIS-DE and ANFIS-GA), were integrated with individual ANFIS as a single-objective optimization. In this study a new multiobjective evolutionary Pareto optimal design of an ANFIS model is developed to evaluate sediment transport in pipe channels. The singular value decomposition (SVD) and bioinspired evolutionary-based optimization algorithm (i.e., DE and GA) are used to optimally improve the Gaussian membership functions of the linear consequent and nonlinear antecedent parameters, respectively, in ANFIS. Two different target functions, which are known as prediction error and training error, are applied, and by using the Pareto curve, the trade-off between these functions is chosen as the optimum modeling point. The developed hybrid ANFIS models (ANFIS-DE/SVD and ANFIS-GA/SVD) and an extensive range of experimental datasets collected from literature are employed to predict the minimum velocity with different input combinations. An assessment of the developed multiobjective ANFIS-based method with single-objective optimization of ANFIS (ANFIS-DE and ANFIS-GA) and individual ANFIS indicates the higher performance of the developed multiobjective techniques (R = 0.99; mean average percentage error = 3.65; root-mean-square error = 0.04; scatter index = 0.01; bias = 0.03; ρ = 0.005). The prediction uncertainty of the developed multiobjective models is quantified and compared with other ones.";ID: 780971;;"Karri,Rama Rao;Ravindran,Gobinath;Dehghani,Mohammad Hadi";Soft Computing Techniques in Solid Waste and Wastewater Management;;Elsevier;;;;;;9,78013E+12;;;;;;;;;https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/B9780128244630000252;https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/B9780128244630000252;https://doi.org/10.1016/B978-0-12-824463-0.00025-2;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;

However, less is known about return spillovers across stock sectors under high and low volatility regimes and whether they are affected by oil price volatility. Using daily data from May 10th, 2007 to February 28th, 2020, we first study the return spillovers between US stock sectors under low and high volatility regimes by implementing a Markov regime-switching vector autoregression with exogenous variables model, while considering the Fama-French factors as conditioning variables. Return spillovers under low and high volatility regimes show that the energy sector is the largest transmitter and receiver of spillovers to/from other US equity sectors. Rolling window analysis shows that spillovers intensified since the outbreak of the COVID19 pandemic. Second, we apply linear and non-linear Granger causality tests from oil price volatility to the spillover indices. The results show evidence that oil volatility has a causal impact on the spillover dynamics of US stock sectors and that the impact is particularly strong in the high volatility regime. Although the energy sector is one of the smallest sectors of the US stock market, it plays a large role in the network connectedness of stock sectors.

Several Markov chain models have been developed and proved to be the potential solutions. However, there is a lack of comparison in terms of accuracy, computing cost, and robustness among these models, which limits their practical application. To this end, this study compared the performance of three Markov chain models, in which the state transfer matrix was calculated based on different principles, i.e., Markov chain model with flux-based method, with Lagrangian tracking, and with set theory approach. The investigation was conducted in a 2D ventilated cavity and a two-zone ventilated chamber. The simulation by Eulerian model for contaminant and experimental data were used as the benchmarks for the 2D and 3D cases, respectively. It is revealed that all three Markov chain models can provide a correct prediction. In the 2D case, the Markov chain model with set theory approach is the most accurate, followed by Lagrangian tracking. In the 3D case, the accuracy of Markov chain models with flux-based method and Lagrangian tracking is comparable. The Markov chain model with Lagrangian tracking is the fastest, and the time step size in this model can be relatively large. Finally, the selection guideline is given for the application of Markov chain models in different scenarios.;ID: 271434;;;;;;;;;;;0360-1323;;;;;;;;;https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0360132321009100;https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0360132321009100;https://doi.org/10.1016/j.buildenv.2021.108515;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;

Logging behavior is driven by multiple human and systems factors, including time constraints, ease of case data retrieval, access to data-entry tools, and procedural code decision tools. Methods We examined case logging trends at three mid-sized, general surgery training programs from September 2016-October 2020, January 2019-October 2020 and May 2019-October 2020, respectively. Across the programs we compared the number of cases logged per week when residents logged directly to ACGME versus via a resident education platform with machine learning-based case logging assistance tools. We examined case logging patterns across 4 consecutive phases: baseline default ACGME logging prior to platform access (P0 “Manual”), full platform logging assistance (P1 “Assisted”), partial platform assistance requiring manual data entry without data integrations (P2 “Notebook”), and resumed fully integrated platform with logging assistance (P3 “Resumed”). Results 31,385 cases were logged utilizing the platform since 2016 by 171 residents across the 3 programs.Intelligent case logging assistance significantly increased case logging rates, from 1.44 ± 1.48 cases by manual entry in P0 to 4.77 ± 2.45 cases per resident per week via the platform in P1 (p-value < 0.00001). Despite the burden of manual data entry when the platform's data connectivity was paused, the tool helped to increase overall case logging into ACGME to 2.85 ± 2.37 cases per week (p-value = 0.0002). Upon resuming the data connectivity, case logging levels rose to 4.54 ± 3.33 cases per week via the platform, equivalent to P1 levels (insignificant difference, p-value = 0.57). Conclusions Mapping the influence of systems and human factors in high-quality case logs allows us to target interventions to continually improve the training of surgical residents. System level factors such as access to alternate automation-drive tools and operative schedule integrated platforms to assist in ACGME case log has a significant impact on the number of cases captured in logs.;ID: 273604;;;;;;;;;;;1931-7204;;;;;;;;;https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S1931720422000137;https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S1931720422000137;https://doi.org/10.1016/j.jsurg.2022.01.013;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;

These inherent endogenous and exogenous uncertainties preclude obtaining an accurate future trend, which in turn complicates the design of the good policy. This study employs Fuzzy Cognitive Maps (FCMs) to semi-quantitatively explore the scenarios of wind energy deployment in Iran. The FCM-based framework was built using participatory workshops and a subsequent questionnaire survey to identify 26 influential factors shaping the dynamics of the system. The developed scenarios originated from the latest narratives of real-world geopolitical variations. The findings demonstrated that the sector is governed by six major groupings of factors predominated by economic and political concepts with strong interconnections between them. Five key concepts, including two economic, one legal, and two political, were ascertained that contribute to the stability of the system. Of the four scenarios, only one optimistic trajectory expects an acceleration in the deployment. Another scenario projects that there will not be any considerable change between the future scheme and the current state of development. However, the other scenarios envisage a substantially slower growth than the current trend.;ID: 271090;;;;;;;;;;;0360-5442;;;;;;;;;https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0360544221019216;https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0360544221019216;https://doi.org/10.1016/j.energy.2021.121673;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;

However, few studies have attempted to use satellite retrieved ozone as an indicator given their low sensitivity in the boundary layer. Using the Troposphere Monitoring Instrument (TROPOMI)'s total ozone column together with the ozone profile information retrieved by the Ozone Monitoring Instrument (OMI), as TROPOMI ozone profile product has not been released, we developed a machine learning model to estimate daily maximum 8-hour average ground-level ozone concentration at 10 km spatial resolution in California. In addition to satellite parameters, we included meteorological fields from the High-Resolution Rapid Refresh (HRRR) system at 3 km resolution and land-use information as predictors. Our model achieved an overall 10-fold cross-validation (CV) R2 of 0.84 with root mean square error (RMSE) of 0.0059 ppm, indicating a good agreement between model predictions and observations. Model predictions showed that the suburb of Los Angeles Metropolitan area had the highest ozone levels, while the Bay Area and the Pacific coast had the lowest. High ozone levels are also seen in Southern California and along the east side of the Central Valley. TROPOMI data improved the estimate of extreme values when compared to a similar model without it.

Peer assessment has been advocated as a means of formative assessment to enhance student engagement, empowering students to take responsibility for their own learning. While there is accumulating evidence for the value of peer assessment in higher education, one cannot assume peer feedback will translate appropriately to all settings and educational contexts. Objectives This study evaluated the implementation of formative online peer assessment in a nursing and midwifery research methods module. We explored students' expectations, experiences, and ultimately the acceptability of this approach. Design A quantitative descriptive study. Setting Ireland. Methods An online survey to collate expectations and experiences of engagement in peer assessment. Scales were drawn from previous research and non-parametric tests explored changes in perceptions over time. Qualitative content analysis explored patterns evident in open-text responses. Results The response rate was 28% (n = 74) at baseline and 31% at follow-up (n = 81). Peer assessment was a new experience for 95% of respondents. Students initially expressed apprehension, perceiving the task as daunting, and doubting their ability to provide feedback to peers. However, through providing instruction and tools to support students in the activity, high levels of satisfaction with the process and the experience were reported. Significant differences in perceptions of peer assessment were evident over time, including an enhanced belief that respondents had the requisite skills to appraise the work of their peers. Conclusions In sum, nursing and midwifery students agreed that peer assessment was a valuable learning experience as part of research methods training and critical skills development.;ID: 272471;;;;;;;;;;;0260-6917;;;;;;;;;https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0260691721004238;https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0260691721004238;https://doi.org/10.1016/j.nedt.2021.105166;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;

The meteorological conditions have always been considered important in influencing bike-usage. Weather changes may lead to shifts in the preferred mode of travel. Studies mostly focus on the average effects and overlook their role in creating barriers. However, each meteorological factor (temperature, humidity, wind speed, precipitation, etc.) can individually disrupt the usage, irrespective of other factors' level. We conduct the necessary condition analysis for climate and weather-related factors, using hourly bicycle usage data for two years at Capital Bikeshare, Washington, D.C., to find barriers to public bicycle system usage. The analysis is performed separately on regular and casual users revealing interesting results. We find that season is not an effective barrier to bike usage. Only an extreme weather condition cause bottleneck. The elements of weather affect the usage of bikes by affecting the comfort and risk associated with riding. Lower temperature creates constraints for all users, whereas only regular bikers are constrained by low humidity. The differences in the necessary condition of regular and casual riders reveal the contrast in the perception of the two groups' comfortable riding conditions, making it essential to design the system accordingly.

The power plant is located in the province of Adrar in the south of Algeria and classified as one of the hot regions worldwide. Performance parameters were reference yield, performance ratio, capacity factor, temperature loss and statistical indicators. The results showed that photovoltaic power plant performance depends on cell technology, insolation, and environmental conditions, especially temperature. The deviations between the simulation results and real monitoring data were found to be smaller in the case of HOMER Pro simulation tool. The total annual energy supplied in 2018 by the power plant was 36364MWh, whereas RETScreen Expert predicted 42339 MWh, or about 14% more and HOMER Pro predicted 34508 MWh or about 5.1% less. The influence of temperature on the power plant output was strong, causing a 40% drop during the summer, due to the limitations of the polycrystalline cell technology. This needs to be considered in the design of future photovoltaic power plants to be operated in hot climates. HOMER Pro and RETScreen Expert predicted an average annual final yield of 5.128 h/day, a module efficiency of 15% and an inverter efficiency of 98%. The t statistics were 3.75 for HOMER Pro and 6.12 for RETScreen Expert. The analysis shows that the 20 MW photovoltaic plant in hot climate experiences high losses compared to an equivalent plant based on thin-film photovoltaic cells.;ID: 311225;;;;;;;;;;;2352-4847;;;;;;;;;https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S235248472101101X;https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S235248472101101X;https://doi.org/10.1016/j.egyr.2021.10.082;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;

This broad class of copulas is introduced and surveyed, including elliptical copulas, skew t copulas, factor copulas, time series copulas and regression copulas. The common auxiliary representation of implicit copulas is outlined, and how this makes them both scalable and tractable for statistical modeling. Issues such as parameter identification, extended likelihoods for discrete or mixed data, parsimony in high dimensions, and simulation from the copula model are considered. Bayesian approaches to estimate the copula parameters, and predict from an implicit copula model, are outlined. Particular attention is given to implicit copula processes constructed from time series and regression models, which is at the forefront of current research. Two econometric applications—one from macroeconomic time series and the other from financial asset pricing—illustrate the advantages of implicit copula models.;ID: 314317;;;;;;;;;;;2452-3062;;;;;;;;;https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S2452306221001465;https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S2452306221001465;https://doi.org/10.1016/j.ecosta.2021.12.002;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;

Empirical evidence from a panel of experts based on Fuzzy Cognitive Maps;Industrial Marketing Management;;2021;;May 2021;95;;99;113;;In recent years, academics and professionals have proposed omnichannel management as the best approach to offering multiple channels to end customers. This approach has been reinforced by the recent crisis caused by Covid-19 and the consequent demand for digital channels. In the current literature there is an evident gap in the study of omnichannel management for manufacturing or wholesale companies and their relationships with other companies, which typically use B2B models. This article includes a model that permits the identification of causal characteristics in omnichannel management based on fuzzy cognitive maps (FCM), the simulation of possible scenarios and the impact that changes in the environment or in the organization's internal activities may have on omnichannel management. From the results of a Delphi process based on an international Panel of Experts and using complexity theory, a Fuzzy Cognitive Map (FCM) was built that can serve as a reference for B2B omnichannel management. The main value of the research is provided by the practical model that allows simulating what-if scenarios, that is, with the modification of the input conditions with respect to a base scenario and thus favors directing the omnichannel strategy to be followed in a B2B field.;ID: 271714;;;;;;;;;;;0019-8501;;;;;;;;;https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0019850121000717;https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0019850121000717;https://doi.org/10.1016/j.indmarman.2021.03.009;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;

We assessed the sensitivity and intrusiveness of 147 primary caregivers (45 fathers, 102 mothers) and 123 secondary caregivers (68 fathers and 55 mothers). All infants were conceived using assisted reproductive techniques and averaged 4 months of age. They were videotaped at home with both parents while engaged in play, feeding, and other childcare (bathing or changing) and these videotapes were coded for sensitivity and intrusiveness. Information about relative levels of caregiving, infant temperament, and twinship was collected via parent report questionnaires. Mixed linear models showed that sensitivity while playing, cleaning, and feeding were not predicted by parental gender, relative parental involvement, and the interaction between parental gender and parental caregiver role. Models for intrusiveness while playing and feeding showed similar results. However, intrusiveness during cleaning was predicted by parental gender and the interaction between parental gender and caregiver role. Post-hoc analyses showed that secondary caregiving fathers showed more intrusive behavior during cleaning (M = 1.51, SD = 0.09) than secondary caregiving mothers (M = 1.26, SD = 0.10). Our results also showed that contextual factors, such as having singletons or twins, infant temperament, and country of residence were related to parenting behavior. In sum, our findings do not support presumptions that mothers are more capable of providing better quality care than fathers, or that, at this early stage, primary caregiving parents are better attuned to their infants than those who are less involved.;ID: 272055;;;;;;;;;;;0885-2006;;;;;;;;;https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S088520062100106X;https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S088520062100106X;https://doi.org/10.1016/j.ecresq.2021.09.002;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;

In this study, a procedure was suggested to assume PV production in a specific district and plan PV systems for the energy-sharing community using a method to identify and quantify daily patterns of PV production based on Discrete Fourier Transform (DFT). To verify its validity, the measured energy production of five PV systems and solar radiation within a district in Jincheon, South Korea, in 2019 were used. The proposed procedure based on the result of the study was as follows: First, apply DFT for daily PV production and solar radiation to convert continuously changing data with respect to time to simple expressions with amplitudes in frequency domain. Second, identify similar patterns in the data with different amplitudes by calculating the distribution of DFT results. Third, compare the DFT distribution of PV production and solar radiation for the same date and defined the relationship between them. Fourth, classify daily solar radiation types with respect to DFT distribution and define the characteristics of solar radiation based on the DFT distribution. Finally, assume annual PV production for a specific district from the past annual solar radiation. The proposed method is expected to accurately predict energy for a district via a simple calculation using past solar radiation data without complex simulation in the design phase of an energy-sharing community. Furthermore, this method can be used to estimate the efficiency of annual PV production for each district. Therefore, this can aid in the decision making for installing PV systems for specific districts.;ID: 271089;;;;;;;;;;;0378-7788;;;;;;;;;https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0378778821010240;https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0378778821010240;https://doi.org/10.1016/j.enbuild.2021.111740;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;

Existing methods are based on relatively small but well-designed lab datasets and controlled test conditions but incorporating field data is crucial to build a complete picture of how cells age in real-world situations. This comes with additional challenges because end-use applications have uncontrolled operating conditions, less accurate sensors, data collection and storage concerns, and infrequent access to validation checks. We explore a range of techniques for estimating lifetime from lab and field data and suggest that combining machine learning approaches with physical models is a promising method, enabling inference of battery life from noisy data, assessment of second-life condition, and extrapolation to future usage conditions.

While both effects, related to the temporal scales where two effects are measured, have been few studied. In this paper, we provide a comprehensive description of the dependence pattern of crude oil market by investigating the heterogeneity of autocorrelation of crude oil future in the framework of multiscale analysis and quantile regression analysis. Our empirical results are based on the price analysis of the West Texas Intermediate (WTI) crude oil future. We use quantile autoregression model to analyze the return and fluctuation series on multiple time scales. Firstly, we find that the autoregressive coefficients are likely to change with quantiles. Secondly, the autoregressive coefficients in the high-frequency components are small while in the low-frequency components are large. It indicates the fact that the crude oil price is a combination of random short-term fluctuation and deterministic long-term tendency. Interestingly, the quantile regressive coefficients for the return series are S-shaped while for the fluctuation series they are inverted S-shaped. In addition, the extreme lagged return and fluctuation are found to affect the distribution of the autoregressive coefficients.;ID: 271683;;;;;;;;;;;0140-9883;;;;;;;;;https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0140988321001444;https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0140988321001444;https://doi.org/10.1016/j.eneco.2021.105239;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;

The main goal is to smooth the real power output from grid-tied wind farms (WFs) and enhance its power quality, which represents a significant concern in the industry. In this regard, two WFs are tied to the network and each one is equipped with a SMES unit. The proposed algorithm takes into consideration the effect of actuating error signal and its magnitude to online update the PI controller gains. The proposed control strategy is applied to all power electronic circuit converters. To obtain a realistic work, practical measured data of wind speed that recorded from Hokkaido Island are incorporated into the analyses. Moreover, a three-drive train model represents a turbine model. A practical 10 MW SMES unit is connected at the WFs terminals. The effectiveness of proposed SMES units is verified by comparing its results with those obtained by using the least mean square-PI SMES units and optimal PI SMES units by genetic algorithm under wind speed variability and uncertainty. The real power can be smoothened by more than 10% using the proposed system at some intervals. The validity of the study is tested by the simulation results that are carried out by PSCAD environment. The controlled SMES units can further improve the power quality of WFs.;ID: 308665;;;;;;;;;;;2352-152X;;;;;;;;;https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S2352152X22002390;https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S2352152X22002390;https://doi.org/10.1016/j.est.2022.104208;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;

We consider the spread by using a branching process and a substitution dynamical system as random and deterministic models, respectively, to approximate the pandemic outbreak. Both approaches are based on the assumption of Markov processing. The deterministic model provides an explicit estimate for the proportion of individuals of a certain type in the particular generation given any initial condition, where a generation means a unit of observation time. The proportion relates to the matrix derived from the Markov setting. In addition, the methodology reveals the efficiency of epidemic control policies, such as vaccine injections or quarantine, by the relative spread rate that is used for the prediction of the number of individuals of a certain type. On the other hand, the stochastic approximation has more of an empirical impact than the deterministic one does. Our investigation explicitly exhibits the spread rate of a certain type with respect to an initial condition of any type. After estimating the average spread rate, the effect of adopting a particular policy can be evaluated. The novelty of this elucidation lies in connecting these two models and introducing the idea of the transition spread model between two topological spread models to capture the change of the spread patterns, which is a real-world phenomenon during the epidemic periods due to changes in the environment or changes in disease control policies. Roughly speaking, the deterministic model is a special case of the stochastic model under some particular probability. Most importantly, with the help of the stochastic model, we establish the transition processing of two deterministic models, which is called a transition model. In other words, any stochastic model is “bounded” by two deterministic models. Moreover, a computable way has been established to predict the long-term spread rate due to the Markov properties of the models and matrix representations for the spread patterns.;ID: 271591;;;;;;;;;;;0960-0779;;;;;;;;;https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0960077921004604;https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0960077921004604;https://doi.org/10.1016/j.chaos.2021.111106;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;

However, the methods to accurately analyze the changes in energy consumption over time have rarely been sufficiently evaluated. This paper compares the effectiveness of conventional weather normalization methods in deriving an accurate indication of the impacts on energy consumption from the changes in building condition. A proposed method based on the degree-days method is presented which aim to increase the accuracy of weather normalization by improving the representation of the energy-weather relationship through (1) excluding the energy consumption during the “shoulder seasons” from the dataset; and (2) applying a weighting exponent to the degree-days ratio. Multi-year building energy simulation was conducted to generate reference values of Typical Year energy consumption without influences from weather variation and the energy consumption affected by Heating, Ventilation, and Air Conditioning system degradation. Normalized annual space heating and cooling energy consumption data were compared to the reference values. Proposed method normalized values from the simulation study are within 2% Coefficient of Variance of the Root Mean Squared Error of the reference values, which is an improvement from the conventional degree-days ratio-based method by 59% for heating energy consumption and 9.7% for cooling energy consumption. Measured data of a case study were normalized to test the proposed method which confirmed minimal changes in energy consumption of the house over the years. The proposed method will be further evaluated when the data for more case studies with known building condition become available.

As a result, the layout of building occupant workstations is likely to influence energy consumption. In this paper, we introduce methods for relating lighting zone energy to zone-level occupant dynamics, simulating energy consumption of a lighting system based on this relationship, and optimizing the layouts of buildings. The optimization makes use of both a clustering-based approach and a genetic algorithm, and it aims to reduce energy consumption. We find in a case study that nonhomogeneous behavior (i.e., high diversity) among occupant schedules positively correlates with the energy consumption of a highly controllable lighting system. We additionally find through data-driven simulation that the naïve clustering-based optimization and the genetic algorithm (which makes use of the energy simulation engine) produce layouts that reduce energy consumption by roughly 5% compared to the existing layout of a real office space comprised of 151 occupants. Overall, this study demonstrates the merits of utilizing low-cost dynamic design of existing building layouts as a means to reduce energy usage.

The results of DY suggest that, first, the total connectedness of 21st century technology assets and traditional common stocks is very high, and hence in the turbulent economy, there is a high probability of contemporaneous losses. Second, Bitcoin, MSCIW, MSCI US, and KFTX are net contributors of volatility shocks whereas US dollar, oil, gold, VIX, green bond and green bond select are net receivers. Therefore, Fintech and common equities are not good hedging instruments in the same portfolio. Third, the short-term witnesses higher volatility transmission than the long-term. That is, holding assets for a long-term is likely to mitigate risks whereas trading financial assets in the short-term can increase risk because of higher volatility. Fourth, the traditional assets, gold and oil, as well as modern assets, green bonds, are useful as good hedgers compared with other assets because shock transmissions from them to Fintech, KFTX are below 0.1% and, more importantly, the total volatility spill-over of all assets in the sample is moderately average, accounting for 44.39%.;ID: 271733;;;;;;;;;;;0040-1625;;;;;;;;;https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0040162520312087;https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0040162520312087;https://doi.org/10.1016/j.techfore.2020.120382;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;

E.;Kemper,Desley";Designing a scoring methodology to quantify the effects of ‘Level 4’ slot allocation at super-congested airports;Transportation Research Procedia;;2021;;2021;56;;29;38;;Before the Covid-19 pandemic significantly reduced the demand for air travel, several European airports were experiencing high levels of congestion. The slot allocation process at these super-congested airports has reached a state of gridlock in which slot mobility is limited and a large block of the available slots is allocated to a small number of airlines. The lack of available capacity has halted the growth of certain airport and/or governmental objectives, such as improving connectivity or minimizing the environmental footprint. As a response to this congestion problem, A.R. Odoni has proposed the implementation of an additional level to the slot allocation process, which would be designed specifically for the saturated airports. This ‘Level 4’ slot category focuses on introducing a set of measures that stimulate the mobility of the slot allocation process whilst simultaneously improve the role of the airport within the local, national and European community. To highlight the importance of this new concept, this research will propose a scoring methodology that will be able to quantify the effectiveness of ‘Level 4’ slot allocation. The methodology will focus on scoring a slot on five different parameters which will allow for a better understanding of the added value of that slot. These parameters are based on the objectives an airport and/or its related government might have. The methodology focusses on the generated connectivity of a slot, the slot’s impact on the competition levels, the welfare contribution of the slot, the slot’s environmental footprint and the capacity offered by the slot. By using the min-max normalization technique, a number of scales are developed that allow for a homogenous scoring method. By using this methodology, the slot allocation process at ‘Level 4’ airports can be based on the added value of a slot, rather than focusing on uncontrolled growth. This will become even more important in a post-pandemic industry where the super-congested airports will likely be the first to recover and slots will need to be re-allocated.;ID: 308315;;;;;;;;;;;2352-1465;;;;;;;;;https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S2352146521006311;https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S2352146521006311;https://doi.org/10.1016/j.trpro.2021.09.004;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;

The diversity of techniques to manage and analyse data has contributed to a wide variety of DBIS. On the one hand, current data management solutions span classical relational databases, distributed (relational and non-relational) systems, document-oriented databases, column stores, in-memory databases, property and knowledge graph databases, stream processors, scientific databases, etc. On the other hand, data analytics techniques range from classical statistical-based data mining, to machine learning, process-oriented data analysis, stream and complex event processing, graph analytics, etc. On top of that, hardware-accelerated solutions, specially related to deep learning and CPU-intensive analytical solutions are complicating the big picture. Nowadays, a prominent research trend is to devise specific data management techniques to accelerate and improve the overall throughput and answer time of DBIS. DOLAP, the International Workshop On Design, Optimization, Languages and Analytical Processing of Big Data, has become a reference discussion forum where to witness the current advances in data management for modern data analytics needs.

Normally, these waste materials are allowed to decay in the natural process or burnt to recover a part of the energy in the thermal form, leading to environmental pollution and loss of value. There is an imperative need to realize that food waste is a bundle of energy, which requires carefully planned recovery without damaging the environment. Conversion of food waste to bio-based liquid or gaseous fuels appears to be an attractive option to meet the escalating demand for fuel and at the same time slowing down the fast-depleting fossil fuel resources. In this context, it is felt appropriate to review the current status of the available technologies which are used in the disposal of food waste in order to identify the variables for process intensification to convert them to fuel keeping in mind the environmental concerns and logistics of utilization. The technologies including incineration, landfill, composting, anaerobic digestion, pyrolysis and biochemical methods have been assessed alongside the recent developing technologies such as hydrothermal carbonization and supercritical water gasification. The critical evaluations of these technologies have been made based on the concepts of life cycle analysis, multi-objective optimization and circular bio-economics which help in assessing the environmental impact. Finally, safety aspects and the way forward are highlighted for future work.

Understanding the characteristics of carbon dioxide (CO2) and particulate matter (PM) in subway stations and train cars is essential in reducing passenger exposure to these pollutants. This study conducted field sampling on two subway lines in Tianjin, China (an old line, L1, and a new line, L6), during the transition season for a period of three weeks. During the first week, the heating, ventilation, and air conditioning (HVAC) systems in subway cars were turned off, while during the following two weeks, the systems were turned on. Measurements were conducted in subway cars, in stations (6 typical above-ground and underground stations), and in the ambient environment simultaneously. The CO2 concentrations in the cars were linearly related to passenger density (p < 0.05), yet independent of the HVAC system. When the HVAC system was off, the CO2 concentrations during the morning and evening peak periods were 2016 ± 567 ppm and 1534 ± 498 ppm, respectively, with the maximum concentrations observed at 3849 ppm and 3282 ppm. When the CO2 concentration was higher than 1500 ppm (Chinese air-quality standard), the exposure time were about 37.6 and 26.5 min, respectively, in the morning and evening peak periods. After the HVAC system was turned on, the CO2 concentrations in the cars dropped by 21–27%. Meanwhile, PM1, PM2.5 and PM10 concentrations in subway cars were 11.1 ± 7.6 μg/m3, 23.1 ± 6.5 μg/m3 and 68.8 ± 15.5 μg/m3, respectively. The ratios of PM concentration in carriage/in station (I/O) for PM1, PM2.5 and PM10 were 0.57, 0.53, and 0.42, respectively. Operating the HVAC systems in subway cars reduced the I/O ratios by 28.2–49.2%. The full-screen doors used on line L6 performed better than the half-screen doors used on line L1 in preventing the diffusion of particles from the tunnel to platforms by the piston effect. Based on the sampling results, possible air control strategies for CO2 and particle pollutants were also evaluated.;ID: 271089;;;;;;;;;;;0378-7788;;;;;;;;;https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S037877882100904X;https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S037877882100904X;https://doi.org/10.1016/j.enbuild.2021.111620;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;

The quality, accuracy and reliability of such information is critical to the road operators and users. Real-time travel time prediction methods using Automatic Number Plate Recognition cameras or Bluetooth/Wi-Fi readers that use matching algorithms to generate travel times in real-time can be vulnerable to an inherent latency issue. Measured travel times are based on vehicles that have already completed the journey and may not be representative for users about to commence that same journey. The aim of this research was to identify the latency in travel time prediction, quantify its effect, and develop a model to remove it. Datasets for the M50 motorway in Dublin, Ireland, were used to conduct the analysis. The results show that real-time travel times can be more accurately predicted when combined with historical travel time information. The approach was found to be valid and achievable and the developed tool can predict and inform both road operators and users during regular periods of congestion. The project also identified other data sources, such as real-time Automated Incident Detection (AID) loop data, incident and weather data, that can further enhance the predicted travel time calculation.;ID: 777615;;;;;;;;;;;2666-691X;;;;;;;;;https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S2666691X20300105;https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S2666691X20300105;https://doi.org/10.1016/j.treng.2020.100009;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;

Reflecting this, diverse city labels, such as ‘sustainable city’ and ‘smart city’, have been mobilized by urban actors and scholars to consider cities’ responses to various challenges of urban transformation. Consequently, this study interrogates: (1) the growing use of city labels in the scientific literature over three decades; (2) the conceptual dimensions of individual city labels and their mutual interdependencies; and (3) likely future trajectories. This is accomplished through a comprehensive bibliometric analysis of 35 city labels: we examine their (co-)occurrences during 1990–2019 based on 11337 articles harvested in Scopus; analyse their conceptual associations drawing on a corpus of 22820 author keywords; and make a future forecast based on logistic growth modelling (the underlying datasets are available through open access). The findings significantly take forward recent bibliometric research by demonstrating: the rapid growth in scientific outputs; the diversification of city labels beyond ‘smart’ and ‘sustainable’; and the evolution of an intricate conceptual field made up of different constellations of city labels. The findings have implications for urban policy and practice: regarding ongoing concerns about how to achieve synergies, rather than trade-offs, between SDGs, the conceptual field points to possible ways for relating SDG 11 to other dimensions of sustainable development.

The role of the booking app and post-booking service quality;Transportation Research Part A: Policy and Practice;;2021;;aug-21;150;;367;384;;Ride-hailing services are increasingly consolidating their role in the transport sector in low- and middle-income countries where there is limited investment in public transport. However, much is unknown about the determinants of ride-hailing service use and quality of the service. The present study investigates the direct and indirect influences of perceived quality of ride-hailing service including perceived booking app and perceived post-booking service quality on continuous usage intention and word-of-mouth (WOM) of ride-hailing passengers. Emerging research has aimed to understand the hierarchical structure of ride-hailing service quality (including booking app and post-booking service). Therefore, this study proposes a formative hierarchical component model of perceived booking app quality consisting of seven dimensions (i.e., privacy and security, ease of use, functionality, design, information accuracy, route detection, and service). Likewise, the perceived post-booking service quality is comprised of four dimensions (i.e., reliability, personal, convenience, and tangibility). Data used for testing the model was collected from 536 ride-hailing service users in Ho Chi Minh city, Vietnam. The results provide insights into attributes forming perceived quality of ride-hailing booking apps and perceived post-booking service quality and how these constructs affect passenger loyalty.

However, AF is often asymptomatic, and frequently remains undiagnosed until complications occur. Current screening approaches for AF lack either cost-effectiveness or diagnostic sensitivity; thus, there is interest in tools that could be used for population screening. An AF risk prediction algorithm, developed using machine learning from a UK dataset of 2,994,837 patients, was found to be more effective than existing models at identifying patients at risk of AF. Therefore, the aim of the trial is to assess the effectiveness of this risk prediction algorithm combined with diagnostic testing for the identification of AF in a real-world primary care setting. Eligible participants (aged ≥30 years and without an existing AF diagnosis) registered at participating UK general practices will be randomised into intervention and control arms.

Control arm participants will be used for comparison and will be managed routinely. The primary outcome is the number of AF diagnoses in the intervention arm compared with the control arm during the research window. If the trial is successful, there is potential for the risk prediction algorithm to be implemented throughout primary care for narrowing the population considered at highest risk for AF who could benefit from more intensive screening for AF.

Decision-making on carrying standard avalanche safety gear among ski tourers in a German touring region;Safety Science;Saf.Sci.;2021;;nov-21;143;;105406;;;Ski touring is a winter sport activity that enjoys increasing popularity. Recreationists practice it exclusively without using ski lifts in the backcountry, where conditions continuously and rapidly change, and avalanche danger exists. Ski tourers can increase their own and others’ avalanche survival chances, among others, by carrying standard avalanche safety equipment (i.e., transceiver, probe, and shovel). Recent studies among backcountry recreationists identify various aspects to influence the decision to ‘carry or not’ this equipment by testing each factor individually for its statistical significance for the decision. This explorative study, in contrast, applies a new methodological approach and considers ‘carry or not’ as a decision process. The analysis bases on the behavioral decision theory and uses the machine learning algorithm decision tree to illustrate the decision process and examine the relative importance of each influencing feature. Therefore, we conduct a researcher-administered survey (n = 359) among ski tourers in a German touring region. According to their carrying behavior, this study classifies ski tourers into three different types: weather-oriented, complex, and conformist. Conformists always carry the avalanche equipment and are known in research. Weather-oriented ski tourers, who predominantly base their decision on environmental conditions (i.e., avalanche danger level and weather), are as new as the complex type, which relies on various features. In contrast to previous findings, personal traits play a subordinate role in the decision process of any type. Furthermore, we interpret environmental aspects in decision-making as decision heuristics that awareness-raising measures and education programs need to address.;ID: 271730;;;;;;;;;;;0925-7535;;;;;;;;;https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0925753521002502;https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0925753521002502;https://doi.org/10.1016/j.ssci.2021.105406;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;

The objective of this study is to understand the travel choices made by rural smallholder farmers in Akwa Ibom State, Nigeria in the face of poor rural road infrastructure. The study uses an existing sampling frame of smallholder farmers obtained from the World Bank-supported Fadama III Project in Akwa Ibom State, and employs multistage sampling to generate data. According to the data, motorcycles are the most owned means of transportation in the study area, and also the most used – even by persons who do not own any means of transportation. Further, we employ the multinomial logit model to examine the factors that influence their choices of means of transportation, and we use motorcycle as the reference category. The result shows that the preference of respondents for the different means of transportation is influenced mainly by the attributes of the means of transportation. In addition, among the socio-economic variables included in the model, only the coefficient of income under saloon cars is significant. Given that motorcycles and tricycles are now dominating the rural transport landscape as an economical way to meet the transport needs of people, rural transport policy in Nigeria should be revised to reflect this reality.

Every year, the world economy uses more than 100,000 million tons of natural resources. Of that consumption, 67,000 million tons are transformed into atmospheric pollution or become solid waste, and only 8,400 million tons are reused, meaning that 24,600 million tons are disposed of annually. Population growth will further increase resource consumption and waste generation meaning that increasing amounts of waste reuse must be tackled. Alkali-activated concrete has utmost importance because it can recycle a high amount of industrial waste, and this is why a change in the terminology used for categorizing these materials is necessary. A system that provides visibility to the high recycling features of these materials and aids in its wide acceptance and application by the construction industry. Furthermore, when governments decide to place high taxes on the extraction of virgin raw materials (like the ones that already exist in some Nordic countries), then alkali-activated concrete mixtures can finally gain a cost-competitive advantage over Portland cement concrete-based mixtures. The chapter includes a brief review on recent alkali-activated concrete developments. An outline of the book is also included.;ID: 781528;;"Pacheco-Torgal,Fernando;Chindaprasirt,Prinya;Ozbakkaloglu,Togay";Handbook of Advances in Alkali-Activated Concrete;;Woodhead Publishing;;;;;Woodhead Publishing Series in Civil and Structural Engineering;9,78032E+12;;;;;;;;;https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/B9780323854696000015;https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/B9780323854696000015;https://doi.org/10.1016/B978-0-323-85469-6.00001-5;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;

The proposed model takes the form of an agent-based model with the Cucker–Smale mechanism, time-delayed interactions and regime-switching. It exhibits a collective behavior “flocking” emerging from the all-to-all coupling with time-delayed interactions induced by the finite propagation speed of communications. We assume that the realized volatility path switches randomly between two regimes. In this setting, we provide theoretical and numerical solutions of the proposed model and show that our proposed theoretical framework is sufficient for volatility’s exponential convergence toward a constant asymptotic value. The longer time-delay makes a volatility converge faster with a lower variance, and we also fit system parameters in the model with the daily observations on stock return and volatility to show model’s high prediction power in both in and out of sample tests.;ID: 271587;;;;;;;;;;;0167-2789;;;;;;;;;https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0167278921002451;https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0167278921002451;https://doi.org/10.1016/j.physd.2021.133088;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;

The future geographic distribution was modelled considering three global circulation models and two extreme representation concentration pathways. Our results showed an elevational change of species composition from cold to warm conditions, increasing the range of the xeric and decreasing of the mesic, with the potential extinction of the endemic species associated to the cooler conditions.

A LEAP model was developed through the below steps: identifying the components of the supply and demand for gasoline in Iran, gathering needed data energy-environmental modeling, designing the structure of gasoline demand and modeling the gasoline demand in Iran, planning the refining and supplying the petroleum products and entering the model data, deigning the reference scenario and validation of the model, planning, modeling, and running of the possible gasoline demand reduction scenarios in Iran. In this study, different non-price and price measures to decrease the gasoline demand in Iran are assessed based on cost-benefit analysis. With the current outlook, the price does not seem to be rising easily. Implementing each of these two scenarios will reduce greenhouse gases, respectively, by 16.93 and 24.96 million metric tonnes of carbon dioxide equivalents in 2035 compared to the baseline.

However, decision support systems are less prevalent to support strategic planning. This paper fills that gap with an original mixed-integer non-convex optimization model, named Airline Network Planning with Supply and Demand interactions (ANPSD). The ANPSD optimizes network planning (including route selection, flight frequencies and fleet composition), while capturing interdependencies between airline supply and passenger demand. We first estimate a demand model as a function of flight frequencies and network configuration, using a two-stage least-squares procedure fitted to historical data, and then formalize the ANPSD by integrating the empirical demand function into an optimization model. The model is formulated as a non-convex mixed-integer program. To solve it, we develop an exact cutting plane algorithm, named 2αECP, which iteratively generates hyperplanes to develop an outer approximation of the non-linear demand functions. Computational results show that the 2αECP algorithm outperforms state-of-the-art benchmarks and generates tight solution quality guarantees. A case study based on the network of a major European carrier shows that the ANPSD provides much stronger solutions than baselines that ignore – fully or partially – demand–supply interactions.;ID: 271728;;;;;;;;;;;0191-2615;;;;;;;;;https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0191261521001703;https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0191261521001703;https://doi.org/10.1016/j.trb.2021.09.003;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;

Moreover, in recent years, new portable and handheld spectrometers have been used to predict chemical composition from spectra captured directly on the cheese surface in dairies, storage facilities, and food plants, removing the need to collect, transport, and process cheese samples. For this review, we selected 71 papers (mainly dealing with prediction of the chemical composition of cheese) and summarized their results, focusing our attention on the major sources of variation in prediction accuracy related to cheese variability, spectrometer and spectra characteristics, and chemometrics techniques. The average coefficient of determination obtained from the validation samples ranged from 86 to 90% for predicting the moisture, fat, and protein contents of cheese, but was lower for predicting NaCl content and cheese pH (79 and 56%, respectively). There was wide variability with respect to all traits in the results of the various studies (standard deviation: 9–30%). This review draws attention to the need for more robust equations for predicting cheese composition in different situations; the calibration data set should consist of representative cheese samples to avoid bias due to an overly specific field of application and ensure the results are not biased for a particular category of cheese. Different spectrometers have different accuracies, which do not seem to depend on the spectrum extension. Furthermore, specific areas of the spectrum—the visible, infrared-A, or infrared-B range—may yield similar results to broad-range spectra; this is because several signals related to cheese composition are distributed along the spectrum. Small, portable instruments have been shown to be viable alternatives to large bench-top instruments. Last, chemometrics (spectra pre-treatment and prediction models) play an important role, especially with regard to difficult-to-predict traits. A proper, fully independent, validation strategy is essential to avoid overoptimistic results.";ID: 279785;;;;;;;;;;;0022-0302;;;;;;;;;https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0022030221010997;https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0022030221010997;https://doi.org/10.3168/jds.2021-20640;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;

The main aim of this study was to examine the relationship between student engagement and creative self-concept in undergraduates. The sample comprised 775 students (51.61 % female, 46.32 % male, 2.07 % other) from two Spanish universities, ranging in age from 17 to 43 years (M = 20.78, SD = 2.65). Students from the first and final year of various degree programs completed the National Survey of Student Engagement and a measure of creative self-concept. Results showed a positive relationship between student engagement and creative self-concept, as well as differences by gender, field of study, and academic year with regard to the dimensions of engagement that contributed most to enhanced creative confidence beliefs. The study highlights the importance of ensuring that students in higher education have the opportunity to participate in collaborative learning, meaningful interactions with faculty, higher-order learning, reflective and integrative learning, and high-impact practices.

To address this problem, this paper develops a novel nonhomogeneous discrete grey model that considers seasonality by introducing a seasonal index into the fractional accumulation generation operator, which is abbreviated as SFNDGM. In addition, the introduction of a one-step ahead rolling mechanism can further improve its prediction performance. To enhance the efficacy, the particle swarm optimization (PSO) algorithm is employed to determine the fractional accumulation order. Subsequently, to demonstrate the effectiveness and superiority of the rolling SFNDGM model, this model is applied to simulate and predict Hubei’s quarterly electricity consumption from 2010Q4 to 2019Q3. The numerical results show that the proposed rolling model has a better performance than the other benchmark models. Therefore, the optimal model is utilized to predict Hubei’s quarterly electricity consumption by 2021, inferring that electricity consumption will continue to increase in the coming years. Based on the attained forecasts, several suggestions are put forward to promote the sustainable development of Hubei’s electricity consumption.;ID: 271090;;;;;;;;;;;0360-5442;;;;;;;;;https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0360544221009622;https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0360544221009622;https://doi.org/10.1016/j.energy.2021.120714;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;

Using emotional contagion and social cognitive theories, we tested the proposition that higher contagion of anger (i.e., a negative emotion that interferes with mental functioning and enables inappropriate behavior) would trigger moral justifications for safety violations, whereas higher contagion of joy (i.e., a positive emotion accompanied by an optimal operating condition and constructive activity) would prevent safety-related moral disengagement. In turn, moral disengagement was predicted to be related to higher rates of subsequent workplace injuries. Using a cross-country and multi-method (i.e., cross-lagged, cross-sectional) design, data from 503 employees in the U.S. (two-wave) and 538 employees in Italy (cross-sectional) supported the hypothesized mediation model. Specifically, both in the U.S. and Italy, emotional contagion of anger positively predicted moral disengagement, whereas emotional contagion of joy negatively predicted moral disengagement. Furthermore, moral disengagement positively predicted experienced injuries and partially mediated the relationship between contagion of joy/anger and injuries. These findings suggest that moral justifications of safety violations, and related injuries, may be prevented by exchanges of positive emotions (and triggered by exchanges of negative emotions) that employees absorb during social interactions at work. Theoretical and practical implications for organizational ethics are discussed in light of the globally increasing emotional pressure and concerns for a safe and psychologically healthy environment in today’s workplace, particularly given the recent pandemic spread of Coronavirus disease (CoVid-19).;ID: 271730;;;;;;;;;;;0925-7535;;;;;;;;;https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0925753521001624;https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0925753521001624;https://doi.org/10.1016/j.ssci.2021.105317;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;

Such analyses and future predictions are imperative to allow decision-makers and stakeholders to accomplish climate-resilient and sustainable development goals by leveraging the power of meaningful and trustworthy projections and insights. We demonstrated that the XAI is capable of predicting the Ec under future climate scenarios with high accuracy (R2>0.9) and reveals the critical inflection points of the daily average outdoor air temperature (Ta) beyond which the Ec increase exponentially. We applied the XAI model for residential and commercial buildings in hot–humid and mixed–humid climate regions to quantify the incremental impacts of climate change on Ec under the different SSPs. The XAI-based analysis concluded positive and persistent incremental changes in the Ec from 2020 to 2100 under all future SSP scenarios, with the maximum incremental impact of 24.5%, 33.3%, 57.8%, and 87.2% in hot–humid and 37.1%, 47.5%, 85.3%, and 121% in mixed–humid climate regions under the sustainable green energy (SSP126), business-as-usual (SSP245), challenges to adaptation (SSP370), and increased reliance on fossil fuels (SSP585) scenarios, respectively.

A drastic fall in the quantity of crude oil produced is fatal to the Nigerian economy since Nigeria depends heavily on the oil sector. Different classical statistical methods have been used to model the crude oil production but the application of machine learning models on crude oil production has been grossly understudied. In this study, we identified a high-performance model between a classical statistical model (ARIMA) and two machine learning models (ANN and RF) in modeling the crude oil production in Nigeria. The monthly data on crude oil production in Nigeria collected from January, 2006 to October, 2020 used in this study is secondary data from Nigerian National Petroleum Corporation (NNPC) and Reuters. The ANN model has a significant modified Diebold–Mariano test when compared with the ARIMA and RF models in the test set. The ANN model had the best trade-off of Root Mean Square Error (RMSE), Mean Absolute Percentage Error (MAPE) and Nash–Sutcliffe Efficiency (NSE) values and was used for forecasting crude oil production in Nigeria. The crude oil production is predicted to increase slightly from March, 2021 (1.67 mmbd) to September, 2021 (1.685 mmbd) before it begins a downward trend from October, 2021 (1.684 mmbd) till it gets to 1.628 mmbd in December, 2023. This predicted fall in the quantity of crude oil produced will obviously affect the Nigerian economy since Nigeria depends solely on the oil sector.

Its focus is to explore spatial disparities of households’ energy burden and their exposure to ambient particulate matters (PM2.5 as end point) in supporting energy efficiency goals of cities. In this study, energy burden is defined as energy affordability of households for paying energy costs. And natural ventilation (NV) is examined as a catalyst of building energy efficiency to measure tradeoffs between energy burden mitigation and exposure to ambient PM2.5 pollution. The framework is built upon a five-step workflow using spatiotemporal land use regression (LUR) with gradient boosting machine (GBM) and bringing human behavioral patterns along with array of urban big data from smart cities platforms into the model to improve the explanatory capacities of the exposure model. We tested Chicago, IL as a case study. Findings indicate the effectiveness of the proposed framework in integrating urban energy and human health systems for envisioning urban building energy reduction goals.

To solve the problem, this research proposes a method for scheduling medical supplies in major public health emergencies to develop a rapid and accurate supply scheme for medical materials, including the allocation of medical materials per vehicle to each hospital and the supply sequence per vehicle to each hospital. Specifically, this paper solves the following two sub-problems: (1) calculating the shortest transportation times and the corresponding routes from any distributing center(s) to any hospital(s); (2) calculating the medical supplies per vehicle transporting to each hospital. The method of solving sub-problem 1 is performed by multiple iterations, each of which calculates the shortest route from a distributing center, through one or more hospitals, and back to the distributing center. According to sub-problem 2, this research proposes a distribution model of medical supplies in major public health emergencies. A multiple dynamic programming algorithm which is a combination of some separated dynamic programming operations is proposed to solve this model. This algorithm also realizes the rapid updating of the scheme in the context of the changing number of vehicles.

Journal Article;RefID:914-mashlakov2021decentralized;"Mashlakov,Aleksei;Pournaras,Evangelos;Nardelli,Pedro H. J.;Honkapuro,Samuli";Decentralized cooperative scheduling of prosumer flexibility under forecast uncertainties;Applied Energy;Appl.Energy;2021;;15 May 2021;290;;116706;;;Scheduling of prosumer flexibility is challenging in finding an optimal allocation of energy resources for heterogeneous prosumer goals under various forecast uncertainties and operation constraints. This study addresses this challenge by introducing a bottom-up framework for cooperative flexibility scheduling that relies on a decentralized network of scheduling agents to perform a coordinated decision-making and select a subset of households’ net load schedules that fulfills the techno-socio-economic prosumer objectives in the resource operation modes and ensures the reliability of the grid. The resource flexibility in terms of alternative operation schedules is mathematically modeled with multiobjective optimization that attains economic, environmental, and energy self-sufficiency prosumer goals with respect to their relative importance. The coordination is achieved with a privacy-preserving collective learning algorithm that aims to reduce the aggregated peak demand of the households considering prosumers’ willingness to cooperate and accept a less preferred resource schedule. By utilizing the framework and real-world data, the novel case study is demonstrated for prosumers equipped with solar battery systems in a community microgrid. The findings show that the flexibility scheduling with an optimal prosumer cooperation level decreases the global costs of collective peak shaving by 83% while increasing the local prosumer costs by 28% in comparison with noncooperative scheduling. However, the forecast uncertainty in net load and parameters of the frequency containment reserve causes imbalances in the planned schedules. It is suggested that the imbalances can be decreased if the flexibility modeling takes into account variable specific levels of forecast uncertainty.;ID: 271429;;;;;;;;;;;0306-2619;;;;;;;;;https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0306261921002270;https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0306261921002270;https://doi.org/10.1016/j.apenergy.2021.116706;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;

It is found that traditional factors should almost always be included as predictors and moving average rotations of the data can provide important gains for various forecasting targets.

With the aid of real-world air quality data collected hourly in different stations throughout Madrid, we present an empirical approach using data-driven techniques with the following goals: (1) Find parsimonious systems of ordinary differential equations via sparse identification of nonlinear dynamics (SINDy) that model the concentration of pollutants and their changes over time; (2) assess the performance and limitations of our models using stability analysis; (3) reconstruct the time series of chemical pollutants not measured in certain stations using delay coordinate embedding results. Our results show that Akaike’s Information Criterion can work well in conjunction with best subset regression as to find an equilibrium between sparsity and goodness of fit. We also find that, due to the complexity of the chemical system under study, identifying the dynamics of this system over longer periods of time require higher levels of data filtering and smoothing.

We have employed Adam–Bashforth–Moulton technique for deriving numerical solutions to the model system. The stability of all equilibrium points has been analyzed with respect to the delay parameter. Utilizing actual data from India COVID-19 instances, the parameters of the fractional order SEIRV model were calculated.

This method includes many techniques for modeling and analyzing several variables to cover real-world problems. The performance basis in conventional regression modeling is based on the assumption that maximum accuracy in inaccessible data is obtained from models with the least amount of error in modeling available data. In this type of regression modeling, in order to maximize the generalization ability of simulations, which are the main factor influencing the quality of decisions made in real-world problems, the principle of maximization of the accuracy of available historical data is used. However, in this type of modeling process, the model's reliability and results have not been considered. On the other, the generalization capability of a model is simultaneously dependent on the accuracy of the model and the reliability level of the accuracy. In this paper, a new methodology is proposed for multiple linear regression (MLR) modeling in which in contrast to traditionally developed models, the models' reliability is maximized instead of its accuracy. To comprehensively evaluate the proposed model's performance, 30 benchmark data sets are considered from the UCI. Empirical results indicate that, from a general perspective, in 19 cases, i.e., 63.333% of cases, the proposed model has better generalization ability than traditional ones. It is clearly illustrated the importance of the reliability of results and their accuracy that is considered in none of the conventional MLR modeling procedures. Therefore, the proposed MLR model can be regarded as an appropriate alternative in modeling fields, especially when more generalization is desired.;ID: 271454;;;;;;;;;;;0263-2241;;;;;;;;;https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0263224121010022;https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0263224121010022;https://doi.org/10.1016/j.measurement.2021.110080;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;

However, the order Rodentia (rodents) also harbors coronaviruses, with two human coronaviruses (HCoV-OC43 and HCoV-HKU1) considered to have rodent origins. The coronavirus spike protein mediates viral entry and is a major determinant of viral tropism; importantly, the spike protein is activated by host cell proteases at two distinct sites, designated as S1/S2 and S2’. SARS-CoV-2, which is considered to be of bat origin, contains a cleavage site for the protease furin at S1/S2, absent from the rest of the currently known betacoronavirus lineage 2b coronaviruses (Sarbecoviruses). This cleavage site is thought to be critical to its replication and pathogenesis, with a notable link to virus transmission. Here, we examine the spike protein across coronaviruses identified in both bat and rodent species and address the role of furin as an activating protease. Utilizing two publicly available furin prediction algorithms (ProP and PiTou) and based on spike sequences reported in GenBank, we show that the S1/S2 furin cleavage site is typically not present in bat virus spike proteins but is common in rodent-associated sequences, and suggest this may have implications for zoonotic transfer. We provide a phylogenetic history of the Embecoviruses (betacoronavirus lineage 2a), including context for the use of furin as an activating protease for the viral spike protein.

Surveys show that 3 out of 4 of these domains are commercial, including microbusinesses as well as websites for both online and brick-and-mortar establishments.

Using statistical matching and time series data, results show the density of domain name hosts positively predicts community economic prosperity, recovery from the 2008 recession, and change in median income. Interactions between the density of these hosts and broadband subscriptions also predict lower monthly unemployment rates over time, including after the March 2020 pandemic.

The resulting optimization problem is solved online in real-time to mitigate demand uncertainty, reducing operating costs, and inventory spoilage. We demonstrate that this approach is equivalent to a data-driven, feedback-based control strategy that relies on manipulating environmental conditions at storage facilities and in transportation equipment. Since large-scale supply chain network instances result in computationally prohibitive optimization problems, a novel and highly efficient heuristic is introduced, that allows for obtaining solutions in practical amounts of time and with negligible degradation in the value of the objective function.

Management of these systems, thus, requires constant diagnose of water quality with fast and efficient methodologies. The conventional methods adopted are, however, time-consuming, often very expensive, and require specialised expertise. Raman spectroscopy (RS) is a simple, fast and label-free technique that can be applied to environmental diagnosis using diatoms. Here, we developed a diagnostic method based on Raman spectroscopy applied to freshwater diatoms. For this, Raman spectra were recorded from diatoms of three lakes of a natural city park. The data acquired was analysed by chemometrics methods to describe the data (Partial Least Squares Regression), infer relationships in the dataset (Cluster Analysis) and produce classification models (Artificial Neural Network). The classification models developed diagnosed the lakes with excellent accuracy (89%) without requiring taxonomic information about the diatom species recorded. This study provides a proof-of-concept for the application of diatom Raman spectroscopy to diagnosing water quality, laying an important foundation for future environmental studies aiming at assessing freshwater systems, to be replicated at larger scales and to varied geographic settings.;ID: 271399;;;;;;;;;;;0956-5663;;;;;;;;;https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S095656632100837X;https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S095656632100837X;https://doi.org/10.1016/j.bios.2021.113800;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;

A new grey prediction model was developed that was the first to combine the idea of twin support vector regression with Hausdorff derivative operator. The new model is a non-linear data-driven model. An improved salp swarm algorithm is used to determine parameters of the model. Two numerical examples show that the error of the new model is smaller than the existing grey prediction models and least square support vector machine model. Moreover, with the displacement, precipitation, reservoir level elevation, variation velocity of reservoir level elevation, and displacement velocity of the previous month as the input variables, the new model was successfully used to predict the displacement of a landslide in the real-world. The new model is a powerful tool for solving nonlinear prediction problems.;ID: 271591;;;;;;;;;;;0960-0779;;;;;;;;;https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0960077921003234;https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0960077921003234;https://doi.org/10.1016/j.chaos.2021.110969;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;

Affected by the high integration of production equipment and the working environment, sensors used to monitor key physical and chemical parameters often have problems that cannot be installed or have low measurement accuracy. As a result, the production process is not transparent enough, and the process optimization lacks data support. Establishing the prediction model of the key physical and chemical parameters can play the function of replacing hardware with software, which is not only economical and reliable, but also has a rapid dynamic response. The traditional mechanism modeling method requires an accurate theoretical foundation and is only suitable for simple process objects. For complex process objects, the model accuracy cannot meet the requirements of the production process. The data-driven modeling method based on historical data and intelligent algorithms has simple process, strong model versatility, and high precision, and is more suitable for modeling complex industrial production processes. This work takes the prediction of the beating degree of tissue paper as an example. First, the historical data of the refining process and pulp fiber parameters are collected and preprocessed. Then, based on the GBDT algorithm, a prediction model of the beating degree is established, and the k-fold cross check method is used to verify the accuracy of the model. The verification results show that the MSE of the GBDT model is 0.9637 SR° and the MAE is 0.7627 SR°, which meets the actual production requirements for the accuracy. With the same precision, compared with the SVM algorithm, the GBDT operation time is only one fiftieth of the SVM, indicating that the GBDT model has a faster operation speed. By analyzing the GBDT model, it is found that specific energy consumption and pulp flow are the variables that have higher influence on the beating degree; the twisted fiber content, fine fiber content, and brooming rate have medium influence, and the remaining variables matter less.";ID: 780372;;"Ren,Jingzheng;Shen,Weifeng;Man,Yi;Dong,Lichun";Applications of Artificial Intelligence in Process Systems Engineering;;Elsevier;;;;;;9,78013E+12;;;;;;;;;https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/B9780128210925000012;https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/B9780128210925000012;https://doi.org/10.1016/B978-0-12-821092-5.00001-2;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;

The pursuit of a major integration for the development of the Internal Energy market is the main driver of this transformation. In this context, the Central Western Europe region implemented for the first time in May 2015 a new and complex mechanism to manage cross-border capacity allocation in the frame of the day-ahead market: the Flow-Based Market Coupling. This paper is the first to consider recent data of the electricity market to develop a predictive model for identifying convergence and congestion situations in the Central Western Europe region. The occurrence of convergence or not is considered as a binary outcome to build a probit model. This model combines meaningful information about the electricity market features of the interconnected countries between 2016 and 2018, including for the first time data on renewable energy sources forecasts for this type of studies. The results of this study identify the major role that Germany and France play in the integration process. The estimated coefficients of the model show that the strong development of solar and wind power in Germany appears as an important driver of congestion in the Central Western Europe. In order to improve the benefits of market integration and the further development of the Internal Energy market, the results of this study encourage policy-makers to promote cooperation and coordination among all the actors involved in the electricity market and to pursue the expansion of the power grid to minimize the occurrence of congestion situations.;ID: 311225;;;;;;;;;;;2352-4847;;;;;;;;;https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S235248472101516X;https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S235248472101516X;https://doi.org/10.1016/j.egyr.2021.12.077;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;

Whereas, existing research on individual mobility prediction mainly focuses on next location prediction and short-term dependencies between traveling locations. Long-term location sequence prediction is of great importance for long-time traffic planning and location advertising, and long-term dependencies exist as individual mobility regularity typically occurs daily and weekly. This paper proposes a novel hierarchical temporal attention-based LSTM encoder-decoder model for individual location sequence prediction. The proposed hierarchical attention mechanism captures both long-term and short-term dependencies underlying in individual longitudinal trajectories, and uncovers frequential and periodical mobility patterns in an interpretable manner by incorporating the calendar cycle of individual travel regularities into location prediction. More specifically, the hierarchical attention consists of local temporal attention to identify highly related locations in each day, and global temporal attention to discern important travel regularities over a week. Experiments on individual trajectory datasets with varying degree of traveling uncertainty demonstrate that our method outperforms four baseline methods on three evaluation metrics. In addition, we explore the interpretability of the proposed model in understanding individual daily, and weekly mobility patterns by visualizing the temporal attention weights and frequent traveling patterns associated with locations.;ID: 271597;;;;;;;;;;;0925-2312;;;;;;;;;https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0925231220304677;https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0925231220304677;https://doi.org/10.1016/j.neucom.2020.03.080;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;

The study follows an extensive calibration procedure to formulate pedestrian behavior within the microsimulation environment to reflect COVID-19 restrictions. The calibration process includes three components, which are visual observations, sensitivity analysis, and parameter combinations. The calibration process identifies the combination of the parameters that yields a pedestrian behavior for maximizing the distances among pedestrians in the airport. The study tests three scenarios: (1) a base case scenario with no social distancing parameters in effect, (2) a social distancing scenario that implements calibrated social force model parameters, and (3) a social distancing scenario through a combined implementation of the calibrated parameters and an operational improvement strategy. The simulation results for calibration reveal that the identified combination of the parameters yields 3.8% of instances of pedestrian movements that demonstrate a proximity of less than 2 m between pedestrians. The social distancing scenario demonstrates a significant reduction of such instances by 93–94% in comparison to a scenario with no social distancing strategy implemented. Moreover, the results show that social distancing is likely to increase pedestrian’s activity and queue time in the airport. According to the simulation results, it appears that the airport authorities may require queue management processes, infrastructure development, and additional resource deployment to alleviate the negative impacts of social distancing policies on pedestrian movements and operations within the airport.;ID: 320511;;;;;;;;;;;2590-1982;;;;;;;;;https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S2590198221002323;https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S2590198221002323;https://doi.org/10.1016/j.trip.2021.100527;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;

Using the elicitability property of VaR, we further use the Model Confidence Set (MCS) technique, which creates superior set models (SSMs) and ranks them based predictive ability of the VaR forecasts. We employ 4580 daily log-returns of Gold, Palladium, Platinum, and Silver, which span January 01, 2000, to April 04, 2018, which covers turbulent (Eurozone and Global Financial crises periods) and tranquil (post-Global Financial crisis period) market conditions. We find that, for both 1% and 5% VaR forecasts, Platinum exhibits a higher level of heterogeneity among models in contrast with Silver, Gold, and Palladium. Hence, Platinum has the smallest number of models in the SSM. Empirically, the homogeneity in the SSM is suggestive of well-diversified portfolios for the respective metals. Except for a few models, both DQ and CC tests support adequate forecast abilities of the respective 1% and 5% VaR models. This suggests the strength of the MCS procedure to select superior set models as compared to the initial set of 38 models.

BSS success requires efficient location of stations and the rebalancing of the network, both of which depend on predicted demand and flows between stations. Therefore, predicting BSS demand is essential to optimize logistic operations, as well as network reliability and availability. The present work develops statistical models to predict the hourly origin–destination demand in the Lisbon BSS network. Models predict the number of trips that will occur between an origin station and a destination station (OD pair) at a certain hour, as well as the duration of such trips. This study also examines the effect of several explaining variables, including the weather, intermodality effects, effects of station location close to different types of points of interest and the time/hour effect. These effects were all tested using different statistical models, including the Generalized Linear Models (GLM) and zero-augmented ones: the hurdle model and the zero-inflated model. The hurdle model showed the best fit to the data and several explaining variables exhibited statistical significant effects. A discussion on the potential logistic and policy impacts of such findings is also provided, so that BSS network design and operations can incorporate them within the urban mobility system policy.;ID: 286278;;;;;;;;;;;2213-624X;;;;;;;;;https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S2213624X21001656;https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S2213624X21001656;https://doi.org/10.1016/j.cstp.2021.10.003;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;

However, capacity has not always matched this increased demand. As such, passengers experience long waiting times and are denied boarding during the peak hours. Crowded platforms and the subsequent customer dissatisfaction and safety issues have become a serious concern. The COVID-19 pandemic has dramatically reduced passengers’ willingness to board crowded trains, causing a surge in demand for real-time crowding information. In this paper, we propose a real-time predictive decision support platform which addresses both, operations control and customer information needs. The system provides crowding predictions on trains and platforms, communicates this information to passengers, and takes into account their response to it. It is demonstrated through a case study that providing predictive information to passengers can potentially reduce denied boarding and lead to better utilization of train capacity.;ID: 271729;;;;;;;;;;;0968-090X;;;;;;;;;https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0968090X21001571;https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0968090X21001571;https://doi.org/10.1016/j.trc.2021.103139;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;

On social media platforms, there are a lot of comments, which contain the user’s most direct views and reactions to the post. They can be utilized as clues to detect rumors. Recently, some methods are proposed to detect rumors through post and comments which usually focus on content information. However, except for this, other information such as reply structure, mutual selection information between post and comments, topic drift within comments also can help detect rumors. In this paper, we propose a novel model, PostCom2DR, for rumor detection. In PostCom2DR, a reply graph between post and comments is first created. Then a bilevel GCN and self-attention mechanism are built to learn the representation of comments. Secondly, a post-comment co-attention mechanism is introduced to selectively fuse information, and this helps the model focus on more relevant information. Through the above modules, we can get the global representation of post and comments. In addition, a 1D CNN is built to capture the local topic drift on time series inside the comments. Finally, we concatenate the global representation and local representation for rumor detection. Extensive experiments conducted on Chinese and English datasets show that PostCom2DR significantly outperforms other state-of-the-art models on both rumor detection and early detection.;ID: 271506;;;;;;;;;;;0957-4174;;;;;;;;;https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S095741742101410X;https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S095741742101410X;https://doi.org/10.1016/j.eswa.2021.116071;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;

Prior studies have built predictive models that relied on structured data from electronic health records (EHRs) to predict the risk of 30-day rehospitalization for patients with HF. Structured data mostly included simple vocabularies such as age, and ethnicity. Rarely do prior studies include clinical narrative data in a free-text format (i.e., unstructured data). No previous study has focused on using clinical narrative notes specifically for Medicare patients with HF in the acute-care setting. Aim To identify clinical notes for building a predictive model for risk of 30-day rehospitalization among Medicate patients with HF. Methods This study first used free-text discharge summary notes and nursing care plans collected from June 1, 2015 to December 31, 2019, for a randomly selected 500 Medicare patients with HF. Natural Language Processing (NLP): we iterated over standard text pre-processing steps, exploring the impact of n-gram length, term document-frequency, word stemming, and the added value of parts-of-speech. We chose two models: 1) the classification model called Bag-of Words (BOW), where each document is represented by a vector based on the pre-processed text, and 2) Document Embedding, where document terms are mapped to a dimension-reducing layer (length equals 300). The latter runs exceptionally fast (on the order of tens-of-seconds for 2,000 documents). Machine Learning (ML): the output of the NLP BOW and Document Embedding models were fed to six different conventional machine learning systems (logistic regression, support vector machine, random forest, k-nearest neighbor clustering, a three-layer neural network, and Naïve Bayes). Results The mean age was 77±7.9, and the average of length of hospital stay was 4.9 days ± 4.8. The best BOW model we found using discharge summaries (n=387) produced an Area Under the Receiver Operating Characteristics Curve (AUC) of 0.71 and F1 score of 0.65. The best Document Embedding model yielded an AUC of 0.65 and an F1 score of 0.61. Using nursing care notes as the unit of analysis (n = 2,046), the NLM/ML performed far better. The best BOW model on care plans found an AUC of 0.85 and F1 score of 0.77. The best Document Embedding produced an AUC of 0.83 and an F1 score of 0.75. In all cases we held out 33% of the data set for validation, repeating a random draw 10 times and averaging the performance results. Conclusions We conclude that nursing care plans are a better predictor of 30-day rehospitalization risk than discharge summaries. Because nursing care plans are shorter than discharge summaries, they have the added advantage of faster processing. Since the faster Document Embedding model's performance is comparable to that of BOW, we suggest its use in future work in the area of 30-day rehospitalization risk in Medicare patients with HF.;ID: 272560;;;;;;;;;;;1071-9164;;;;;;;;;https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S1071916420309702;https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S1071916420309702;https://doi.org/10.1016/j.cardfail.2020.09.023;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;

The aim of this paper is to identify the determinants of logistics performance and investigate its empirical linkages with economic and environmental indicators. We built a macro-level dataset for the top 25 ranked logistics countries from 2007 to 2018, conducting a set of panel data tests on cross-sectional dependence, stationarity and cointegration, to provide preliminary insights. Empirical estimates from Fully Modified Ordinary Least Squares (FMOLS), Generalized Method of Moments (GMM), and Quantile Regression (QR) model suggest that technological innovation, Human Development Index (HDI), urbanization, and trade openness significantly boost logistic performance, whereas employment and Gross Fixed Capital Formation (GFCF) fail to respond in such a desirable path. In turn, an increase in the Logistic Performance Index (LPI) is found to worsen economic growth. Finally, LPI exhibits a large positive effect on carbon emissions, which is congruent with a strand of the literature highlighting that the modern supply chain is far from being decarbonized. Thus, this evidence further suggest that more global efforts should be geared to attain a sustainable logistics.;ID: 271750;;;;;;;;;;;0959-6526;;;;;;;;;https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S095965262103239X;https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S095965262103239X;https://doi.org/10.1016/j.jclepro.2021.129050;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;

This work is an attempt to develop two forms of hybrid solar cells, one by the amalgamation of zinc oxide and carbon quantum dots and second, by incorporating graphene oxide into zinc oxide. In this study, optimization, validation, and comparison of the photovoltaic parameters of the two nanostructured solar cells were attempted using the Artificial Neural Network technique. The ANN was instructed using the Firefly Algorithm. The input parameters are the spectral power density and temperature. The output parameters are the short circuit current (ISC), open-circuit voltage (VOC), fill factor of the cell (FF), and maximum voltage point prediction (VMPP). The results obtained for both the hybrid solar cells were compared and it was noted that the addition of CQDs to ZnO resulted in a considerable increase in the values of ISC, VOC and FF. The output obtained by the ANN trained model was compared with the results obtained from the experimental tests. It is observed that there is considerable agreement between the results obtained from the ANN and experimental values. The optimized values of VOC, ISC, FF, VMPP, Incident Photon to Current Efficiency (IPCE), Power Conversion Efficiency (PCE) for ZnO/GO are 0.623 V, 0.546 mA, 62%, 0.509 V, 36.95%, 9.12% respectively. Similarly values of VOC, ISC, FF, VMPP, IPCE, PCE for ZnO/CQDs are 0.636 V, 0.597 mA, 68%, 0.531 V, 40.72%, 10.35% respectively. Therefore, the precise values of all the stated parameters were obtained for both the cells after optimization and hybrid cells made of CQDs proves to be a better candidate. Also, the desirable value of the coefficient of correlation (R) is obtained, approximately close to 1, which means that the fabricated samples are efficient for useful applications. Proper execution of this algorithm on any model of the hybrid solar cell can lead to an evolution in the field of solar cells, resulting in the improvement of efficiency. These optimized cells have been utilized to propose two models of solar trigeneration system used in a commercial building North Service Centre (Olefin building) of Haldia Petrochemicals Limited, Haldia, West Bengal, India. The trigeneration systems were based on photovoltaic modules, heat pump and photovoltaic-thermal collectors. The objective is to provide enough electricity, domestic hot water, heating and cooling power to meet the typical demand of a single office building. System performance has been predicted and evaluated in the work. Considerations should be made regarding the physical constraints imposed by the environment where the installation has to be performed. The location should be carefully selected to achieve maximum efficiency.;ID: 282793;;;;;;;;;;;2213-1388;;;;;;;;;https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S2213138821003672;https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S2213138821003672;https://doi.org/10.1016/j.seta.2021.101357;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;

As one of the automated approaches, content-based rumor defeating is a pipeline that could be divided into four sequential sub-tasks: detection, tracking, sentence classification, and veracity. Specifically, rumor tracking gathers relevant posts and filters unrelated posts for a potential rumor news, which is significant for rumor defeating and has not been studied extensively. However, the existing proposals only consider rumor tracking as an auxiliary task in multi-task learning without special optimization, therefore restraining the accuracy of tracking performance. To this end, we propose a deep reinforcement learning based ensemble model for rumor tracking (RL-ERT), which aggregates multiple components by a weight-tuning policy network, and utilizes specific social features to improve the performance. Finally, we conduct experiments on public datasets and the experimental results show the superiority of RL-ERT on efficiency and effectiveness.;ID: 271528;;;;;;;;;;;0306-4379;;;;;;;;;https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0306437921000314;https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0306437921000314;https://doi.org/10.1016/j.is.2021.101772;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;

With the intent of overcoming these deficiencies, an integrated method based on the demand-side analysis is proposed in this study to assess the gas supply reliability of the large-scale and complex natural gas pipeline network. The method is composed of the establishment of the indicator system, the demand-side analysis, the estimation of the unit failure probability, and the calculation of the gas supply. Among them, the demand-side analysis focuses on the market demand forecasting and user importance research. Moreover, the coupling effect of the user importance, the hydraulic and pressure constraints, and the unit failure on the gas supply calculation is considered. Furthermore, a real natural gas pipeline network located in China is applied to confirm the feasibility of the method. According to the evaluation results of the gas supply reliability, the weakest nodes and key links of the natural gas pipeline network are identified, and the suggestions to improve the gas supply reliability are proposed as well.

In spite of some research on the factors influencing freight truck-related crashes in major cities, the literature offers limited evidence about the effects of the built environment on the occurrence of those crashes by injury severity. This article uses data from the Los Angeles region in 2010–2019 to explore the relationships between the built environment factors and the spatial distribution of freight truck-related crashes using XGBoost and SHAP methods. Results from the XGBoost model show that variables related to the built environment, in particular demographics, land uses and road network, are highly correlated to freight truck related crashes of all three injury types. The SHAP value plots further indicate the important nonlinear relationships between independent variables and dependent variables. This study also emphasizes the differences in modeling mechanisms between the XGBoost model and traditional statistical models.

To this aim, we first find the optimal weights of the currencies that can comprise our basket. We then employ volatility spillover decomposition methods to understand which foreign currency mostly drives the others. We then look at how the stability of either stablecoin is affected by currency shocks by means of spillover networks built on VAR models. Our empirical findings show that our basket based stablecoin is less volatile than all single currencies. This result is fundamental for policy making, and especially for emerging markets with a high level of remittances: a Librae (basket based stablecoin) can preserve their value during turbolent times better than a Libra (single currency based stablecoin).;ID: 273054;;;;;;;;;;;1544-6123;;;;;;;;;https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S1544612321001355;https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S1544612321001355;https://doi.org/10.1016/j.frl.2021.102054;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;

Especially, deep learning algorithms have been adopted in several studies and promising results have been obtained. However, the cross-domain fault diagnostic problem still remains a challenging issue, where the training and testing data are collected from different operating conditions of the machine. To bridge the domain gap in the training and testing data and increase the model generalization ability, a domain adaptation approach is proposed in this paper within the deep learning framework. Multiple convolutional operations are employed for automatic feature extraction. The maximum mean discrepancy is used to optimize the distributions of the learned features for accurate diagnosis. To further enhance the model generalization ability, the health condition labels of the data are injected with additional noise during model training. Experiments on a bearing fault diagnosis dataset are carried out for validation. The results show that, compared with the popular transfer learning algorithms, the proposed method with noisy health labels can successfully improve the cross-domain diagnosis performance on rotating machines.;ID: 306234;;;;;;;;;;;2351-9789;;;;;;;;;https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S2351978920315857;https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S2351978920315857;https://doi.org/10.1016/j.promfg.2020.05.133;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;

Currently, trajectory prediction and fuel estimation are usually accomplished via complex mathematical energy-balance methods. In these methods, the prediction error could get increased due to the possible usage of global values and outdated database, resulting from that most of the information regarding aircraft operations is unavailable. In this paper, we propose a covariance bidirectional extreme learning machine (CovB-ELM) for predicting aircraft trajectories and estimating fuel consumption. The selection of randomly generated parameters for the hidden unit, such as the input weight and bias, to improve the accuracy and numerical stability of the extreme learning machine (ELM), is an open problem. The fundamental idea behind the proposed method is to maximise the covariance between the hidden unit and network errors through partially updating the hidden-unit parameters randomly generated in bidirectional ELM so that the output weight norm value is minimised and the convergence gets improved. The merits of the proposed CovB-ELM are demonstrated by the experiments involving regression problems and international airline historically flight data, which suggests that the CovB-ELM outperforms, in terms of generalisation performance, several existing methods, e.g., airline mathematical approach, backpropagation neural network, and constructive ELM methods.;ID: 271717;;;;;;;;;;;1366-5545;;;;;;;;;https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S1366554520308310;https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S1366554520308310;https://doi.org/10.1016/j.tre.2020.102189;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;

However, one of the variables in energy prediction models, occupant behavior, is crucial for prediction performance but hard-to-measure or time-consuming to collect from each building. This study proposes an approach that utilizes the search volume of topics (e.g., education or Microsoft Excel) on the Google Trends platform as a proxy of occupant behavior and use of buildings. Linear correlations were first examined to explore the relationship between energy meter data and Google Trends search terms to infer building occupancy. Prediction errors before and after the inclusion of the trends of these terms were compared and analyzed based on the ASHRAE Great Energy Predictor III (GEPIII) competition dataset. The results show that highly correlated Google Trends data can effectively reduce the overall RMSLE error for a subset of the buildings to the level of the GEPIII competition’s top five winning teams’ performance. In particular, the RMSLE error reduction during public holidays and days with site-specific schedules are respectively reduced by 20–30% and 2–5%. These results show the potential of using Google Trends to improve energy prediction for a portion of the building stock by automatically identifying site-specific and holiday schedules.;ID: 271429;;;;;;;;;;;0306-2619;;;;;;;;;https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0306261921015919;https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0306261921015919;https://doi.org/10.1016/j.apenergy.2021.118343;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;

Two VOC databases for the building indoor environment (from 251 occupied residences) and the aircraft cabin environment (from 56 commercial flights) were compared, to determine the common compounds (detection rate (DR) > 70%) in the two environments and the characteristic VOCs (only those with high DR during flights) in aircraft cabins. Possible VOC emission sources in flights were also discussed. As TVOC is usually viewed as a general indicator of air quality, the prediction of TVOC concentration was carried out using BP neural network algorithm, and the average error between the predicted and measured values was 55.35 μg/m3 (R2 = 0.80). Meanwhile, the VOCs’ inhalation cancer/non-cancer risks to crew members and passengers were calculated on the basis of detection rates, exposure concentrations, and health risk assessments. Six compounds (i.e., formaldehyde, benzene, tetrachloroethylene, trichloromethane, 1,2-dichloroethane, and naphthalene) were proposed as the key VOCs in the existing aircraft cabin environment, presenting a risk to crew members that is higher than the US EPA proposed acceptable level (evaluated mean value > 1E-06). The estimated lifetime excess cancer/non-cancer risks for passengers were all below the assessment criteria.

The aim of this study is to investigate the impact of FinTech products (FTPs) on commercial bank's performance in China. Required data are collected with a quantitative approach and two self-designed questionnaires were distributed to customers and employees of commercial banks in China. The gathered data were examined using the structural equation modeling technique. The results of this study reveal that the perceived usefulness (PU) of FTPs has positive and significant impacts on customer satisfaction, low expectation of bank employee assistance, bank's service quality and employee work efficiency. Additionally, the perceived difficulty of use (PD) of FTPs has negative and significant impacts on customer satisfaction and low expectation of assistance. Interestingly, there is a positive and significant relationship between PD and banks' service quality and work efficiency, meaning that the service quality and work efficiency can reduce some shortcomings of using FTPs.

The monthly data of monetary and fiscal policy uncertainties, gold, silver, and S&P-500 prices from January 1987 to November 2020 are used. The empirical results reveal that the overall spillovers among the system variables are weak. Further, the cross-spillovers between precious metals and policy uncertainties are found to be lower than the cross-spillovers between equity and policy uncertainties. The decomposition of overall spillovers into various frequencies indicate that shorter followed by longer and medium time-horizons drive overall spillovers. The frequency-based results reveal that cross-spillovers between policy uncertainties and equity are mostly driven by shorter horizons. Whereas, the cross-spillovers between policy uncertainties and precious metals are driven by longer horizons. Thus, it appears that precious metals are relatively more immune to the shocks from policy uncertainties than equity markets, thereby suggesting safe investment opportunities in precious metals during economic policy uncertainties.

Several recent findings suggest that enhancing deep sleep (N3) may improve neurological health in persons with MCI, and buffer the risk for AD. Specifically, Transcranial Electrical Stimulation (TES) of frontal brain areas, the inferred source of the Slow Oscillations (SOs) of N3 sleep, can extend N3 sleep duration and improve declarative memory for recently learned information. Recent work in our laboratory using dense array Electroencephalography (dEEG) localized the sources of SOs to anterior limbic sites – suggesting that targeting these sites with TES may be more effective for enhancing N3. Methods For the present study, we recruited 13 healthy adults (M = 42 years) to participate in three all-night sleep EEG recordings where they received low level (0.5 mA) TES designed to target anterior limbic areas and a sham stimulation (placebo). We used a convolutional neural network, trained and tested on professionally scored EEG sleep staging, to predict sleep stages for each recording. Results When compared to the sham session, limbic-targeted TES significantly increased the duration of N3 sleep.

We need to be better prepared for finding ways to stem such outbreaks. Except from social distancing and wearing face masks, restricting the movement of people is one important measure necessary to control the spread. Such decisions on the lock-down/reduction of movement should be made in an informed way and, accordingly, modeled as an optimization problem. We propose the Early-stage Transportation Lock-down and Quarantine Problem (TLQP), which can help to decide which parts of the transportation infrastructure of a country should be restricted in early stages. On top of the network-based Susceptible-Exposed-Infectious-Recovered (SEIR) model, we establish a decision recommendation framework, which considers the lock-down of cross-border traffic, internal traffic, and movement inside individual populations. The combinatorial optimization problem aims to find the best set of actions which minimize the social cost of a lock-down. Given the inherent intractability of this problem, we develop a highly-efficient heuristic based on the Effective Distance (ED) path and the Cost-Effective Lazy Forward (CELF) algorithm. We perform and report experiments on the global spread of COVID-19 and show how individual countries may protect their population by taking appropriate measures against the threatening pandemic. We believe that our study contributes to the orchestration of measures for dealing with current and future epidemic outbreaks.;ID: 271729;;;;;;;;;;;0968-090X;;;;;;;;;https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0968090X21002321;https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0968090X21002321;https://doi.org/10.1016/j.trc.2021.103218;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
Journal Article;RefID:857-pelagidis2021capesize;"Pelagidis,Theodore;Karaoulanis,Ioannis";Capesize markets behavior: Explaining volatility and expectations;The Asian Journal of Shipping and Logistics;;2021;;March 2021;37;1;82;90;;It is widely accepted that the highly volatile capesize market has many peculiarities. Its importance has been recently highlighted by an increase in contribution of the Baltic Capesize Index (BCI) to the Baltic Dry Index (BDI), affecting the progress of the BDI more than any other dry bulk index. This paper investigates the behavior of the capesize market focusing on expectations and time lags. Expectations play a critical role in the freight market both for the short-term and the long-term decision making. In particular, we investigate the relation between time lags and time-charter, trip and spot market rates as well as the average earnings of the capesize vessels of various ages. Time series analysis is used to reach our conclusions. The Hannan – Quinn criterion has been selected to identify the important lags of the capesize freight market for the period 1977–2018 and an Autoregressive (AR) model has been constructed to perform the statistical analysis. The findings indicate that there is a strong correlation between time lags and capesize freight market, forecasting indeed the behavior of the market. At a practical level, better understanding of the behavior of the capesize market can improve the planning decision of ship-owners and charterers alike.;ID: 282329;;;;;;;;;;;2092-5212;;;;;;;;;https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S2092521220300559;https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S2092521220300559;https://doi.org/10.1016/j.ajsl.2020.08.001;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;

To do it, we propose to consider the classification as a multi-objective optimization problem and construct a prediction model as an ensemble while minimizing the parameters FPR (False Positive Rate) and FNR (False Negative Rate) at the same time. To create the ensemble, the proposed algorithm of a Multi-Objective Classifier Selection (MOCS) selects only classifiers that belong to the Pareto-optimal set in FPR/FNR space; that is, there is no dominance between them, and they satisfy some additional conditions. In the general case, MOCS is determined by three parameters: two threshold values that limit false rates (FNR and FPR), and the crowding distance, which defines the uniqueness of the classifier's results. We tested the proposed algorithm on data collected from 2457 Russian companies, 456 of which went bankrupt, and 5910 Polish companies, 410 of which received bankruptcy status. Datasets contain features such as financial ratios and business environment factors. In the testing, we used more than 70 combinations of under-sampling, over-sampling, and no sampling methods with static and dynamic classification models. Final ensembles include seven classifiers for the Russian dataset and four classifiers for the Polish dataset combined by soft voting rule. In both cases, the proposed algorithm produces a significant improvement of prediction results as in terms of standard metrics (geometric mean, the area under the ROC curve) and in the visual representation in the FNR/FPR space, namely in the shift from a Pareto-optimal set of classifiers.";ID: 271506;;;;;;;;;;;0957-4174;;;;;;;;;https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0957417421009659;https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0957417421009659;https://doi.org/10.1016/j.eswa.2021.115559;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;

This paper focusses on the Iberian energy market by dealing with the analysis of the relationship between energy consumption and energy prices by using fractional integration in the Iberian market. This technique is used in order to examine the degree of persistence of the series, looking at the spot and futures markets in Spain and Portugal. The results indicate that all the series are fractionally integrated, showing long memory and mean reverting behaviour. Moreover, a close relation between energy consumption and energy prices is found in the spot market whereas it is not found in the futures market. In fact, there is a weak relationship between the futures market and energy consumption.

So-called omnichannel (OC) concepts leverage stores to offer seamless and enhanced operations for offline and online shoppers. Stores are used to fulfill online orders, offer shorter lead times to customers, and extend the assortment across channels. The role of the store and the underlying store operations are thus impacted by profound changes. This transformation has not yet been assessed comprehensively from a practical or an Operations Research (OR) lens. This paper identifies cross-cutting store-related planning issues and develops a planning framework for OC operations. We apply industry interviews and a systematic literature analysis to derive five planning issues. Research gaps are revealed by matching the pertinent OR literature with managerial needs. The planning issues network design of fulfillment locations, assignment of customer orders, and assortment and inventory planning have been discussed in several store-related OC publications.

Empirical analysis uses daily prices to compose minimum variance (MVP) and maximum Sharpe ratio (MSR) long-only portfolios, and also includes their performances during the COVID-19 pandemic. MF-DFA indicated a multifractal nature for asset price returns, generally associated with long-term persistence. The strategy using the most efficient equities resulted in portfolios with lower levels of systematic risk (betas), indicating that the lack of efficiency is related to higher sensitivity to macroeconomic and conjuncture changes. The MVP portfolio produces higher performance than the alternatives in terms of risk and return.

The daily data used are from 7 August 2015 to 15 June 2020. The dataset is analyzed in its entirety and is also subdivided into four distinct subsets in order to study and compare the patterns of spillover effects during economic turmoil, such as the 2018 cryptocurrency crash and the COVID-19 pandemic. The results reveal significant co-volatility spillover effects between cryptocurrency and traditional currency or gold markets, especially during the whole sample period and amid the uncertainty raised by COVID-19. The capabilities of cryptocurrency are time-varying and related to economic uncertainty or shocks. There are significant differences between normal and extreme markets with regard to the capabilities of cryptocurrency as a diversifier, a hedge or a safe haven. We find the significant co-volatility spillover effects are asymmetric in most cases especially during the COVID-19 pandemic period, which means the negative return shocks have larger impacts on co-volatility than positive return shocks of the same magnitude. Evidently, cryptocurrencies and traditional currencies or gold can be incorporated into financial portfolios for financial market participants who seek effective risk management and also for optimal dynamic hedging purposes against economic turmoil and downward movements.;ID: 272105;;;;;;;;;;;1062-9408;;;;;;;;;https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S1062940821000711;https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S1062940821000711;https://doi.org/10.1016/j.najef.2021.101443;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;

Primary space usage (PSU) is a typical and widely used commercial building categorization method. The PSU labels are ascertained once the buildings are put into use but not always modified on time when the building usages change, which may lead to false results in analysis. In this paper, we propose a method to identify mislabeled commercial buildings based on analysis of the energy time series collected by electric meters. The method is constructed as follows: (1) data cleaning and transformation; (2) three types of temporal feature extraction; (3) several single classifier training, and the ensemble classifier building; (4) mislabel building identification and correction. The method provides a supervise way to identify mislabeled building. We applied the method to a public dataset from the Department of General Services from Washington, D.C. and found that 22.4% of the buildings were mislabeled. We also designed 1000 evaluation cases to prove the effectiveness of the method. Based on the results of the cases and the good interpretation of the method, we discuss the mislabeled buildings in reality and the temporal differences among different PSU-type buildings.

The tail risk measure peaks at stock market crashes, financial crises, political shocks and disaster events such as the coronavirus pandemic. Moreover, I find that tail risk is countercyclical, has strong predictive power for market returns and negatively predicts real economic activity. In order to identify the investors’ concerns associated with tail risk, I extract daily news from the largest financial newspaper in Brazil. The co-movement between news and tail risk indicates that tail risk variation is mainly driven by disaster concerns, followed by economic and government uncertainty. While economic uncertainty explains the countercyclical property of tail risk, investors only require compensation for bearing tail risk implied by disaster concerns. Similarly, tail risk negatively impacts real outcomes because of the disaster concerns that it identifies. These findings support recent models explaining asset pricing puzzles with time-varying disaster risk.;ID: 272105;;;;;;;;;;;1062-9408;;;;;;;;;https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S1062940821001364;https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S1062940821001364;https://doi.org/10.1016/j.najef.2021.101519;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;

Conventional encoder–decoder model based abstractive summarization methods often suffer from repetition and semantic irrelevance. Recent studies apply traditional attention or graph-based attention on the encoder–decoder model to tackle the problem, under the assumption that all the sentences in the original document are indistinguishable from each other. But in a document, the same words in different sentences are not equally important, i.e., the words in a trivial sentence are less important than the words in a salient sentence. Based on it, we develop a HITS-based attention mechanism in this paper, which fully leverages sentence-level and word-level information by considering sentences and words in the original document as authorities and hubs. Based on it, we present a novel abstractive summarization method, with Kullback–Leibler (KL) divergence to refine the attention value, meanwhile we propose a comparison mechanism in summary generation to further improve the summarization performance. When evaluated on the CNN/Daily Mail and NYT datasets, the experimental results demonstrate the improvement of summarization performance and show the performance of our proposed method is comparable with that of the other summarization methods.

We examine the impact of connecting passenger arrival delays on network delay propagation by using passenger level data combined with flight delay data that allow us to analyse the correlation between delayed incoming flights and departure delays at the 21 U.S. airports with most delays, in July 2018. Results show that correlation between daily arrival delays and daily carrier induced departure delays are statistically significant only for flights carrying high proportions of connecting passengers. Correlation values are also higher for short-to-moderate arrival delays. In addition, a Neural Network model was trained for six major airports to build a delay prediction model and map the potential delay propagation. The results of the propagation scenarios suggest that the presence of a unique dominant carrier at an airport translates into a stronger correlation between arrival and carrier delays than that at airports where different carriers compete for connecting passengers.

Considering the cooperation of wind power bidding and energy storage system (ESS) operation with uncertainty, this paper proposes a coordinated bidding/operation model for the wind farm to improve its benefits in the electricity market. The maximum entropy based deep reinforcement learning (RL) algorithm, Soft Actor-Critic (SAC) is used to construct the model. The maximum entropy framework enables the designed agent to explore various optimal possibilities, which means the learned coordinated bidding/operation strategy is more stable considering the forecasting error. Particularly, penalty terms are introduced into the benefit function to relax the constraints and improve the convergency. The case study illustrates that the learned policy can effectively improve the wind farm benefit while ensuring robustness.;ID: 311225;;;;;;;;;;;2352-4847;;;;;;;;;https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S2352484721013627;https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S2352484721013627;https://doi.org/10.1016/j.egyr.2021.11.216;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;

However, they have caused major issues by utilizing random partitioning of the universe of discourse and ignoring repeated fuzzy sets. In this study, a novel hybrid forecasting model by integrating fuzzy time series to Markov chain and C-Means clustering techniques with an optimal number of clusters is presented. This hybridization contributes to generating effective lengths of intervals and thus, improving the model accuracy. The proposed model was verified and validated with real time series data sets, which are the benchmark data of actual trading of Taiwan Stock Exchange Capitalization Weighted Stock Index (TAIEX) and PM10 concentration data from Melaka, Malaysia. In addition, a comparison was made with some existing fuzzy time series models. Furthermore, the mean absolute percentage error, mean squared error and Theil's U statistic were calculated as evaluation criteria to illustrate the performance of the proposed model. The empirical analysis shows that the proposed model handles the time series data sets more efficiently and provides better overall forecasting results than existing FTS models. The results prove that the proposed model has greatly improved the prediction accuracy, for which it outperforms several fuzzy time series models. Therefore, it can be concluded that the proposed model is a better option for forecasting air pollution parameters and any kind of random parameters.;ID: 272576;;;;;;;;;;;0147-6513;;;;;;;;;https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0147651321009878;https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0147651321009878;https://doi.org/10.1016/j.ecoenv.2021.112875;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;

A search-engine-based research study location protocol identified 107 studies that had focused on such predictions. By applying filters 45 relevant studies were found to address appropriate time horizons and focus on national/international scale predictions. The analysis presented of these relevant studies provides insight concerning the range of prediction methodologies adopted, the prediction influencing factors (inputs) and time horizons typically employed. Whereas short-term predictions are widely considered across global energy markets, long-term natural gas demand forecasts are most studied in Asia, particularly China, India, and Turkey. These areas are characterized by rapidly expanding gas demand and the recent construction of large gas-related infrastructure developments. Most natura gas prediction studies persist in deriving single deterministic forward-looking trends based only on quantitative data that tend to be less useful to policy makers than several potential trends reflecting alternative possible future scenarios that incorporate data from both qualitative and quantitative influencing variables. Apart from a few exceptions, most long-term gas prediction studies fail to adequately consider environmental and sustainability criteria. A strong case can be made that in coming years the consideration such influencing factors, plus competition from renewable energies will become essential in long-term forecasting of natural gas demand from national and global perspectives. A case study, evaluating a learning scenario development model with six alternative futures provides long-term global gas demand forecasts incorporating sustainability input variables. Banner headline Close review of relevant gas prediction studies recently published provides insight regarding the methods used, and the time horizons, and geographic areas concentrated upon.

To that end, multiple heuristics have been developed in literature. Nevertheless, due to the lack of ground truth home location data, no study has thoroughly validated these widely used methods so far. We present a detailed performance analysis of existing home detection heuristics, using a unique dataset that enables this important validation on the lowest level, being the level of the cell tower. Our research indicates that simple heuristics surprisingly outperform their more complex counterparts. The benchmark study revealed that the best heuristic is able to identify the home location with an average error of approximately 4.5 km and selects the correct home tower in 60.69% of the cases. Based on the insights provided by our study, we propose a new heuristic that increases the accuracy to 61% and lowers the average distance error to 4.365 km. Secondly, if the home location is known for possibly only a fraction of the instances, we propose a labelled predictive modelling approach. Adding social network based variables in this predictive model further enhances the predictive performance. Our best model reduces the average distance error to 2.848 km and selects the correct home location in 72.08% of the cases. Furthermore, this result provides an indication of the upper bound for home detection with CDR data. Finally, models that only make use of social network based data are developed as well. Results show that even without using data of the focal individual, these models are able to select the correct home tower in 37.65% of the cases and achieve an average distance error of 8.1 km.;ID: 271506;;;;;;;;;;;0957-4174;;;;;;;;;https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0957417420311519;https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0957417420311519;https://doi.org/10.1016/j.eswa.2020.114507;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;

The control of airflow patterns has been examined, yet it remains problematic owing to a number of factors related to the location of the air inlets and outlets, and distributions of the indoor pollutants. Herein, we present a novel ventilation control strategy using artificial intelligence to rapidly remove hazardous airborne materials in an isolation room. The isolation room was designed with nine inlets on the ceiling and six outlets at the floor level to control airflow patterns through selective on/off switching of the inlets. To build a database of the indoor environment, numerical simulations were performed on different distributions of airborne particles and airflow patterns. We preprocessed the dispersion data of the airborne particles by discretizing the simulated volume into several cuboids and averaging the concentration data for use as the input variables for artificial intelligence. The artificial intelligence model predicted an efficient ventilation condition based on the distribution of the airborne materials within a prediction accuracy of 91%. The controlled strategy decreased the removal time up to maximum 63.65%, compared to conventional ventilation system. Furthermore, the proposed control strategies for airflow patterns can effectively prevent the spread of infectious viruses and reduce the risk of indoor infection transmission.;ID: 271434;;;;;;;;;;;0360-1323;;;;;;;;;https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0360132321005497;https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0360132321005497;https://doi.org/10.1016/j.buildenv.2021.108148;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;

However, current frameworks devised for the estimation of the NSC of O3, CO, and NO2 have defects, such as coarse spatial resolution and large missing coverage. To address this issue, this study aims to estimate the daily (~13:30 local time) full-coverage NSC of O3, CO, and NO2 at a high spatial resolution (0.05° for O3 and NO2; 0.07° for CO) over China by using datasets from S5P-TROPOMI and GEOS-FP. In specific, the light gradient boosting machine is employed to train the estimation models. Validation results show that the NSC of O3, CO, and NO2 are well estimated, with the R2s of 0.91, 0.71, and 0.83 for the sample-based cross validation, respectively. Meanwhile, the proposed framework achieves a satisfactory performance in comparison to the latest related works, as reflected by the estimation accuracy and spatial resolution. As for the mapping, the estimated results show coherent spatial distribution and can accurately grasp the seasonal characteristics of each air pollutant. Finally, the estimated results are utilized to analyze the temporal variations of O3, CO, and NO2 during the COrona VIrus Disease 2019 (COVID-19) lockdown in China, which is an extend application for adopting the proposed framework in air quality monitoring.

In the building sector, sensors along with other information sources provide the basis for smart building functionalities. Predicting energy loads and inferring occupancy status of spaces are important tasks that promote energy efficiency and user comfort in buildings. For them, as for many other smart building applications, machine learning modelling utilizing sensor data is commonly applied. This article builds understanding of the environment where this kind of machine learning models have to operate by bringing up properties and quality aspects of the public building data provided by indoor sensor devices. This is done by performing a thorough case study on two real life data sets from university campus buildings located in different climates and applying very different sensor network settings. Outcomes include information about heterogeneity, correlations and temporal patterns present in sensor data, and show the need of the building field for better acknowledging the quality deficiencies that sensor data have.

As such, efforts to predict the evolution and estimate statistically significant effects of covariates related to this air pollutant are recommended. Bayesian, econometrics and machine learning models are applied to predict future values of sulfur dioxide emissions in the vicinity of the most relevant thermoelectric power plant located in Portugal. Based on a multivariate time series analysis containing data that ranges from July 2017 to April 2020, several conclusions are identified. Predicted values of sulfur dioxide emissions of the five models exhibiting the lowest forecast error are strongly correlated, particularly in the interval 0.35± 0.10μg/m3. The application of multi-step ahead forecasting analysis and nonlinear ensemble algorithms reinforces the main result from the one-step ahead forecasting exercise, where it is demonstrated that machine learning models have a better generalization power compared to classical approaches. Additionally, an identification strategy is proposed to assess the efficacy of a firm-specific measure adopted in 2017 (i.e., qualitative improvement of the desulfurization process to reduce the level of sulfur dioxide emissions). Super learning algorithms confirm that sulfur dioxide emissions in 2017 were approximately 19% greater relative to the period 2018–2020, which allows to conclude that the effort promoted by the firm was effective. From a regulatory point of view, this study confirms that Portugal is likely to satisfy 2030 targets imposed by supranational regulation for sulfur dioxide emissions and provides useful recommendations to ensure the persistence of best air quality sustainability practices.;ID: 271750;;;;;;;;;;;0959-6526;;;;;;;;;https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0959652621025713;https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0959652621025713;https://doi.org/10.1016/j.jclepro.2021.128358;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;

The conventional machine learning (ML) and deep learning approaches need to share customer’s sensitive information with an external credit bureau to generate a prediction model that opens up the door of privacy leakage. A recently invented privacy-preserving distributed ML scheme referred to as Federated learning (FL) enables generating a target model without sharing local information through on-device model training on edge resources. In this paper, we propose an FL-based application to predict customers’ financial issues by constructing a global learning model that is evolved based on the local models of the distributed agents. The local models are generated by the network agents using their on-device data and local resources. We used the FL concept because the learning strategy does not require sharing any data with the server or any other agent that ensures the preservation of customers’ sensitive data. To that end, we enable partial works from the weak agents that eliminate the issue if the model convergence is retarded due to straggler agents. We also leverage asynchronous FL that cut off the extra waiting time during global model generation. We simulated the performance of our FL model considering a popular dataset, Give me Some Credit (Freshcorn, 2017). We evaluated our proposed method considering a a different number of stragglers and setting up various computational tasks (e.g., local epoch, batch size), and simulated the training loss and testing accuracy of the prediction model. Finally, we compared the F1-score of our proposed model with the existing centralized and decentralized approaches. Our results show that our proposed model achieves an almost identical F1-score as like centralized model even when we set up a skew-level of more than 80% and outperforms the state-of-the-art FL models by obtaining an average of 5∼6% higher accuracy when we have resource-constrained agents within a learning environment.;ID: 779210;;;;;;;;;;;2667-3053;;;;;;;;;https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S2667305322000059;https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S2667305322000059;https://doi.org/10.1016/j.iswa.2022.200064;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;

While encouraging shared rides has environmental benefits, little is known about how price affects the decision to share. Using TNC trip data from Chicago, we investigate the temporal and spatial distribution of authorized ride-splitting trips in 2019. We found that the willingness to share TNC trips differed across neighborhoods with different demographics, socioeconomic status, and built environment characteristics. The willingness to share was related to price and trip duration. We estimate logistic regression and random forest models to determine the marginal price and time effects on the decision to share. The results indicate the probability of authorizing a ride-splitting trip is highly elastic to the price per mile and the random forest model had better predictive accuracy than the logistic model. Additionally, we examine the importance and marginal effects of total price and trip duration. We use two data preprocessing methods to address rounding errors in the price and demonstrate the robustness of the results.

In this study, we aim to study the reducing effects of integrated air curtain and exhaust systems on atmospheric airborne particles entering into the metro stations. Validated turbulent models were adopted for numerical simulations. The associated effects of air curtain velocity, exhaust velocity, and atmospheric wind speed were investigated. Four different installation locations of the air curtain were considered. Subsequently, monitoring, Artificial Neural Network, and air purification methods were proposed for the optimal design of integrated air curtain and exhaust system. It is concluded that an integrated air curtain and exhaust system can improve the interception efficiency on particles around 40% compared with no measure taken at the subway entrance, or it can be increased about 20% compared with only using an air curtain system (no exhaust vent) at the entrance.;ID: 271089;;;;;;;;;;;0378-7788;;;;;;;;;https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0378778821003121;https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0378778821003121;https://doi.org/10.1016/j.enbuild.2021.111028;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;

This study presents a comprehensive review of the documented impact of air pollution and PV soiling on solar resources and techno-economic performances of PV systems. Both air pollution attenuation and soiling could significantly reduce the solar PV power generation globally, and soiling losses contribute to most of the total power reduction in most regions except in high-polluted areas. In addition, considering the natural soiling processes, the influencing parameters of soiling such as environmental and configurational factors and their correlation to dust deposition on PV surface are discussed. Furthermore, this study introduces the impact of air pollution elimination on surface solar radiation and solar PV power generation. Given the current novel coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) pandemic, studies related to its effects on the solar PV sector are discussed in the present review. The reported soiling mitigation approaches and technologies are systematically compared. Finally, the current research challenges are stated, and suggestions for future works in improving the penetration of solar PV applications are provided to help promote solar power generation towards carbon neutrality all over the world.;ID: 271429;;;;;;;;;;;0306-2619;;;;;;;;;https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S030626192100667X;https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S030626192100667X;https://doi.org/10.1016/j.apenergy.2021.117247;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;

The aim of this study was to provide on-demand heating for the buildings. A temperature and time-sharing dynamic control approach was developed by integrating three energy-saving heating patterns. Given that different heating patterns had different set temperatures, unreasonable patterns switching time would cause indoor temperature to deviate from set value. To address this issue, equivalent thermal capacity of building was introduced to establish an indoor temperature prediction model and to determine the appropriate switching time. The practical application of proposed approach was based on the control system with wireless indoor temperature monitoring. A group of buildings with the same demand temperature could be controlled by one control system. A DHS in a university was selected as a case study to validate the proposed method. The experimental works include short-term and long-term validation. Short-term daily comparative experiments showed that the approach could yield heat-saving and heating on-demand for different buildings. Four heating seasons’ long-term operation data indicated the approach could save annual heat use by 14.6%–28.7%. The energy-saving effect also yielded considerable economic and environmental benefits.;ID: 271090;;;;;;;;;;;0360-5442;;;;;;;;;https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0360544221000840;https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0360544221000840;https://doi.org/10.1016/j.energy.2021.119835;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;

Using a global computable general equilibrium (CGE) model, this study evaluates the environmental and economic impacts of COVID-19 on the world, both today and in the longer term. This study explores the post-pandemic impacts conditional on varied fiscal policies (including forgone revenue and additional spending) and their combination with a carbon tax. This study finds that the pandemic shocks in 2020 slowed regional economies worldwide, and a continued pandemic in 2021 will further stymie economic activity. Among the government’s recovery policies, indirect tax reduction has the best positive stimulus to regional economies; however, it is not conducive to low-carbon energy development and will also lead to an increase in CO2 and pollutant emissions. A post-pandemic green recovery plan could prioritize replacing indirect production taxes with taxes on GHG emissions, which would both improve economic turnover metrics and reduce environmental emissions in 2021. In the long run, this tax shift will not only minimize the economic damage to the global economy but also help governments around the world to get back on track in meeting the goals of the Paris Agreement.";ID: 305628;;;;;;;;;;;0313-5926;;;;;;;;;https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0313592621001272;https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0313592621001272;https://doi.org/10.1016/j.eap.2021.09.009;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;

Three common data-driven models are used to predict city-scale daily electricity usage: linear regression models, machine learning models for time series data, and machine learning models for tabular data. In this study, we developed and compared seven data-driven models: (1) five-parameter change-point model, (2) Heating/Cooling Degree Hour model, (3) time series decomposed model implemented by Facebook Prophet, (4) Gradient Boosting Machine implemented by Microsoft lightGBM, and (5) three widely-used machine learning models (Random Forest, Support Vector Machine, Neural Network). Seven models are applied to the city-scale electricity usage data for three metropolitan areas in the United States: Sacramento, Los Angeles, and New York. Results show seven models can predict the metropolitan area's daily electricity use, with a coefficient of variation of the root mean square error (CVRMSE) less than 10%. The lightGBM provides the most accurate results, with CVRMSE on the test dataset of 6.5% for Los Angeles, 4.6% for Sacramento, and 4.1% for the New York metropolitan area. These models are further applied to explore how extreme weather events (e.g., heat waves) and unexpected public health events (e.g., COVID-19 pandemic) influence each city's electricity demand. Results show weather-sensitive component accounts for 30%–50% of the total daily electricity usage. Every degree Celsius ambient temperature increase in summer leads to about 5% (4.7% in Los Angeles, 6.2% in Sacramento, and 5.1% in New York) more daily electricity usage compared with the base load in the three metropolitan areas. The COVID-19 pandemic reduced city-scale electricity demand: compared with the pre-pandemic same months in 2019, daily electricity usage during the 2020 pandemic decreased by 10% in April and started to rebound in summer.;ID: 777797;;;;;;;;;;;2666-7924;;;;;;;;;https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S2666792421000184;https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S2666792421000184;https://doi.org/10.1016/j.adapen.2021.100025;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
Journal Article;RefID:819-graf2021(machine);"Graf,Christoph;Quaglia,Federico;Wolak,Frank A.";(Machine) learning from the COVID-19 lockdown about electricity market performance with a large share of renewables;Journal of Environmental Economics and Management;J.Environ.Econ.Manage.;2021;;January 2021;105;;102398;;;The negative demand shock due to the COVID-19 lockdown has reduced net demand for electricity—system demand less amount of energy produced by intermittent renewables, hydroelectric units, and net imports—that must be served by controllable generation units. Under normal demand conditions, introducing additional renewable generation capacity reduces net demand. Consequently, the lockdown can provide insights about electricity market performance with a large share of renewables. We find that although the lockdown reduced average day-ahead prices in Italy by 45%, re-dispatch costs increased by 73%, both relative to the average of the same magnitude for the same period in previous years. We estimate a deep-learning model using data from 2017 to 2019 and find that predicted re-dispatch costs during the lockdown period are only 26% higher than the same period in previous years. We argue that the difference between actual and predicted lockdown period re-dispatch costs is the result of increased opportunities for suppliers with controllable units to exercise market power in the re-dispatch market in these persistently low net demand conditions. Our results imply that without grid investments and other technologies to manage low net demand conditions, an increased share of intermittent renewables is likely to increase the costs of maintaining a reliable grid.;ID: 272401;;;;;;;;;;;0095-0696;;;;;;;;;https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0095069620301212;https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0095069620301212;https://doi.org/10.1016/j.jeem.2020.102398;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;

In these regions, the impossibility of collecting all the required data to compute FAO-56 Penman–Monteith equation (FAO56-PM) makes scientists search new methodologies to accurately estimate ET0 with the minimum number of climatic parameters. In this work, several neural network approaches have been evaluated for estimating ET0 using datasets from five weather stations located in Southern Spain (semiarid region of Andalusia). The assessment of statistical performance (Root Mean Square Error -RMSE-, Mean Bias Error -MBE-, coefficient of determination -R2- and Nash-Sutcliffe model efficiency coefficient -NSE-) of models namely Multilayer perceptron (MLP), Generalized Regression Neural Network (GRNN), Extreme Learning Machine (ELM), Support Vector Machines (SVM), Random Forest (RF) and XGBoost were carried out using different input variables configurations. Only temperature-based data were used as inputs; the calculation of new variables called EnergyT (the integral of the half hourly temperature values of a day) and Hourmin (the difference in hours between time sunset and the time when the maximum temperature occurs) had promising results for the most humid stations. The good results obtained with EnergyT when it is used as an input of the system demonstrated that the information contained on it gives detailed characterization of the daily thermic behavior at each location, resulting in a more efficient model than those using only daily maximum, minimum temperature and extraterrestrial radiation values. In general, the modeling results showed that no model firmly outperformed the others, although MLP and ELM were commonly the models that gave the best performances for all sites: mean values of R2 > 0.89, mean values of NSE > 0.88, mean values of RMSE < 0.67 mm/day and mean values of MBE ranging from −0.17 to 0.30 mm/day. Therefore, EnergyT and Hourmin can be used to estimate ET0 more accurately in stations where data acquisition is limited, like in developing countries or at low-cost weather stations that cannot collect all the required meteorological variables used in FAO56-PM. Overall, the use of ELM is recommended due to its high performance in terms of efficiency (NSE) for all the configurations and for all locations, especially using EnergyT as an input variable.";ID: 271238;;;;;;;;;;;0378-3774;;;;;;;;;https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0378377420321053;https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0378377420321053;https://doi.org/10.1016/j.agwat.2020.106558;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;

The required primary data were gathered from the end-users of mHealth in Bangladesh. Using the Unified Theory of Acceptance and Use of Technology (UTAUT2), this study has confirmed that performance expectancy, effort expectancy, social influence, hedonic motivation, and facilitating conditions have a positive influence on behavioral intention whereas health consciousness has an impact on both intention and actual usage behavior. mHealth usage behavior has an affirmative and meaningful effect on the mental well-being of the service users. Moreover, self-quarantine has strong influence on actual usage behavior but does not moderate the intention-behavior relationship. In addition, due to the existence of a non-linearity problem in the data set, the Artificial Neural Network (ANN) approach was engaged to sort out relatively significant predictors acquired from Structural Equation Modeling (SEM).

The current forest fires in the West Coast of the United States (US) profoundly impacted the atmosphere and air quality across the ecosystems and have caused severe environmental and public health burdens. Forest fire led emissions could significantly exacerbate the air pollution level and, therefore, would play a critical role if the same occurs together with any epidemic and pandemic health crisis. Limited research is done so far to examine its impact in connection to the current pandemic. As of October 21, nearly 8.2 million acres of forest area were burned, with more than 25 casualties reported so far. In-situ air pollution data were utilized to examine the effects of the 2020 forest fire on atmosphere and coronavirus (COVID-19) casualties. The spatial-temporal concentrations of particulate matter (PM2.5 and PM10) and Nitrogen Dioxide (NO2) were collected from August 1 to October 30 for 2020 (the fire year) and 2019 (the reference year). Both spatial (Multiscale Geographically Weighted Regression) and non-spatial (Negative Binomial Regression) analyses were performed to assess the adverse effects of fire emission on human health. The in-situ data-led measurements showed that the maximum increases in PM2.5, PM10, and NO2 concentrations (μg/m3) were clustered in the West Coastal fire-prone states during August 1 – October 30, 2020. The average concentration (μg/m3) of particulate matter (PM2.5 and PM10) and NO2 was increased in all the fire states severely affected by forest fires. The average PM2.5 concentrations (μg/m3) over the period were recorded as 7.9, 6.3, 5.5, and 5.2 for California, Colorado, Oregon, and Washington in 2019, increasing up to 24.9, 13.4, 25.0, and 17.0 in 2020. Both spatial and non-spatial regression models exhibited a statistically significant association between fire emission and COVID-19 incidents. Such association has been demonstrated robust and stable by a total of 30 models developed for analyzing the spatial non-stationary and local association. More in-depth research is needed to better understand the complex relationship between forest fire emission and human health.;ID: 272394;;;;;;;;;;;0013-9351;;;;;;;;;https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0013935122001451;https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0013935122001451;https://doi.org/10.1016/j.envres.2022.112818;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;

The concept coming from Fractal theory, known as the fractal dimension, can be utilized to measure the complexity of the dynamic behavior of a non-linear plant. On the other hand, fuzzy logic theory can be used to represent and capture the expert knowledge in controlling a plant. In addition, fuzzy logic enables to manage the uncertainty involved in the decision-making process for achieving efficient control of a non-linear plant.

This virus was first identified around December 2019, from central China, but later spread in the rest of the world. To ensure better healthcare service management, an accurate prediction of the uncertain gruesomeness is situational demand. In orders with limited information frameworks, demonstrating and predicting COVID-19 turns into a challenging endeavor. The primary objective of this study is to propose a hybrid model that incorporates ensemble empirical mode decomposition (EEMD) and artificial neural network (ANN) for predicting the COVID-19 epidemic. A real-time COVID-19 time series data has been used on the window periods January 22, 2020, to May 18, 2020. The time-series data first decomposed using EEMD to produce sub-signals and make original data denoised, and ANN architecture has built to train the denoised data. Finally, the result of the proposed model has compared with some traditional statistical analysis. The result of this investigation shows our proposed model outperforms compared with traditional statistical analysis. Thus the model might be promising for COVID-19 epidemic prediction.

We identified 24 peptide stretches on the SARS-CoV-2 S protein that are well conserved among the reported strains. The S protein structure further validated the presence of predicted peptides on the surface, of which 20 are surface exposed and predicted to have reasonable epitope binding efficiency. The work could be useful for understanding the immunodominant regions in the surface protein of SARS-CoV-2 and could potentially help in designing some peptide-based diagnostics.

Many residents changed their travel behavior during and after the pandemic, especially for a certain percentage of public transport users who chose to drive their owned vehicles. Thus, urban roadway congestion has been getting worse, and the spatiotemporal congestion patterns has changed significantly. Understanding spatiotemporal heterogeneity of urban roadway congestion during and post the pandemic is essential for mobility management. In this study, an analytical framework was proposed to investigate the spatiotemporal heterogeneity of urban roadway congestion in Shanghai, China. First, the matrix of average speed in each traffic analysis zones (TAZs) was calculated to extract spatiotemporal heterogeneity variation features. Second, the heterogenous component of each TAZ was extracted from the overall traffic characteristics using robust principal component analysis (RPCA). Third, clustering analysis was employed to explain the spatiotemporal distribution of heterogeneous traffic characteristics. Finally, fluctuation features of these characteristics were analyzed by iterated cumulative sums of squares (ICSS). The case study results suggested that the urban road traffic state evolution was complicated and varied significantly in different zones and periods during the long-term pandemic. Compared with suburban areas, traffic conditions in city central areas are more susceptible to the pandemic and other events. In some areas, the heterogeneous component shows opposite characteristics on working days and holidays with others. The key time nodes of state change for different areas have commonness and individuality.

The challenges faced are particularly daunting for pharmaceutical companies producing vaccines with ever-growing demand and shorter and shorter deadlines to fulfill them. Further, due to the vaccine's novelty and unprecedented demand, there is a lack of any available data on which traditional forecasting methods can be used. In this paper, we attempt to propose a solution by utilizing the Grey Systems Theory, particularly the AGM (1, 1) model, which has been used to significant effect for problems involving uncertain / lack of data to forecast the demand for vaccines. The experimental results obtained showed that our proposed model successfully generated accurate forecasts with a small dataset and minimal error. Additionally, judgmental forecasting has been used to qualitatively assess the future scope of vaccine manufacturing as well as the use cases of the model. We can thus effectively say proposed AGM (1,1) model is a lucid method to forecast the demand for vaccines.;ID: 305927;;;;;;;;;;;2214-7853;;;;;;;;;https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S2214785321082924;https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S2214785321082924;https://doi.org/10.1016/j.matpr.2021.12.531;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;

Evidence for the walking liberty half dollar;European Research on Management and Business Economics;;2021;;September–December 2021;27;3;100167;;;Unstable fluctuations in financial markets caused by the 2008 financial crisis and currently by the Covid-19 crisis have generated greater concern among investors regarding their capital protection. In view of this situation, the consideration of alternative investments has taken a relevant position to protect their wealth and obtain profits. Due to the relevance of these investments in these times, this study proposes using artificial intelligence to predict the value of alternative investments, specifically the numismatic asset the Walking Liberty Half Dollar. To achieve this objective, the use of Generalized Regression Neural Networks has been proposed over a sample 25 coins of the Walking Liberty Half Dollar with several qualities valued in the period 2000-2019. Two models were proposed, one for the entire selected sample and the other one for each type of coin depending on its year of minting. Thus, it has been found that the model proposed for the entire sample has a success rate of between 86.12% and 97% while the approach for each type of coin obtained success rates that even reach 100%. The variables that have the greatest influence within the model are the state of conservation of the coin, its age, and its exclusivity. In this way, these results provide fundamental information to investors to understand the behaviour of these assets, and to be able to formulate more profitable investment portfolios, especially in times of great economic instability.;ID: 314573;;;;;;;;;;;2444-8834;;;;;;;;;https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S2444883421000267;https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S2444883421000267;https://doi.org/10.1016/j.iedeen.2021.100167;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;

This study provided a new way to investigate the impact of the pandemic on carbon emissions by calculating the difference between the pandemic-free carbon emissions and the actual carbon emissions in 2020 based on scenario analysis. In this work, derived from Autoregressive Integrated Moving Average (ARIMA) method and Back Propagation Neural Network (BPNN) method, two combined ARIMA-BPNN and BPNN-ARIMA simulation approaches were developed to simulate the carbon emissions of China, India, U.S. and EU under the pandemic-free scenario. The average relative error of the simulation was about 1%, which could provide reliable simulation results. The scenario simulation of carbon emission reduction in the US and EU were almost the same as the inter-annual change rate of carbon emissions reported by the existing statistics. However, the scenario simulation of carbon emission reduction in China and India is 5% larger than the inter-annual change rate of carbon emissions reported by the existing statistics. In some sense, the impact of the pandemic on carbon emission reduction in developing countries might be underestimated.

Although the extant research has acknowledged and examined this relationship, the measures of financial attitude and behavior still vary widely and are generally posed as a series of questions rather than statements. In addition to this, there is insufficient knowledge regarding retail investors' behavior in the face of a health crisis, such as the current COVID-19 pandemic. This study addresses these gaps in the prior literature by examining the relative influence of six dimensions of financial attitude, namely, financial anxiety, optimism, financial security, deliberative thinking, interest in financial issues, and needs for precautionary savings, on the trading activity of retail investors during the pandemic. Data were collected from 404 respondents and analyzed using the artificial neural network (ANN) method. The results revealed that all six dimensions had a positive influence on trading activity, with interest in financial issues exerting the strongest influence, followed by deliberative thinking. The study thus contributes important inferences for researchers and managers.;ID: 271706;;;;;;;;;;;0969-6989;;;;;;;;;https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0969698920313497;https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0969698920313497;https://doi.org/10.1016/j.jretconser.2020.102341;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;

Mostly the developed countries have been hit hard, besides the emerging countries like China, India and Brazil. The scientists and the policy makers are in dark with respect to its spread and claiming lives in coming days. Objectives The present study aims to forecast the number of incidences in severely affected seven countries, USA, UK, Italy, Spain, France, China and India, for the period July 12-Septmeber 11, 2020 and compares the forecasted values with the actual values to judge its depth of severity and growth. Method The study uses Box-Jenkins method of forecasting in an Autoregressive Integrated Moving Average (ARIMA) structure on the basis of the daily data published by World Health Organization from January 21st to July 11, 2020. Results It is observed that USA and India are the two countries whose increasing trends will continue in the forecasted period (July 12 to September 11), others except China will face lower number of incidences. China's incidence has come to halt around 80000 in numbers. The growth rates of the number of incidences for all the countries during the forecasted period will be diminishing. The mean difference test results between the forecasted and actual values in level and growth forms show that in the former case, USA, India, UK will face increasing forecast than the actual number but in the latter case, all of the countries will face significantly decreasing growth rates in the forecasted values compared to their actual growth values.;ID: 271591;;;;;;;;;;;0960-0779;;;;;;;;;https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0960077920306445;https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0960077920306445;https://doi.org/10.1016/j.chaos.2020.110248;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;

Therefore, this work studied the three time series approximations and their combinations considering two analyses: the first one considers different historical data baseline for the Brazil (SIN) and its subsystems to forecast the electricity demand from 2021 to 2025, then the percent error with EPE predictions are calculated for the same period. The second approach analysis the percent error of the electricity demand from 2014 to 2019, with the real historical data for the Brazil (SIN) and its subsystems. The results indicates that the Regression with Seasonality has the best approaches, and the combination of the time series methods helps to reduce the error of the approximations.

The TREC-COVID Challenge was created to evaluate information retrieval (IR) methods and systems for this quickly expanding corpus. Using the COVID-19 Open Research Dataset (CORD-19), several dozen research teams participated in over 5 rounds of the TREC-COVID Challenge. While previous work has compared IR techniques used on other test collections, there are no studies that have analyzed the methods used by participants in the TREC-COVID Challenge. We manually reviewed team run reports from Rounds 2 and 5, extracted features from the documented methodologies, and used a univariate and multivariate regression-based analysis to identify features associated with higher retrieval performance. We observed that fine-tuning datasets with relevance judgments, MS-MARCO, and CORD-19 document vectors was associated with improved performance in Round 2 but not in Round 5. Though the relatively decreased heterogeneity of runs in Round 5 may explain the lack of significance in that round, fine-tuning has been found to improve search performance in previous challenge evaluations by improving a system’s ability to map relevant queries and phrases to documents. Furthermore, term expansion was associated with improvement in system performance, and the use of the narrative field in the TREC-COVID topics was associated with decreased system performance in both rounds. These findings emphasize the need for clear queries in search. While our study has some limitations in its generalizability and scope of techniques analyzed, we identified some IR techniques that may be useful in building search systems for COVID-19 using the TREC-COVID test collections.;ID: 272371;;;;;;;;;;;1532-0464;;;;;;;;;https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S1532046421000745;https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S1532046421000745;https://doi.org/10.1016/j.jbi.2021.103745;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;

However, price movements present more complex nonlinear behavior due to an increasingly diverse range of risk factors. To achieve better accuracy, this study explores a novel multiscale hybrid paradigm to estimate crude oil prices. The method takes advantage of the variational mode decomposition method to decompose the crude oil price into several simple models, which can be explained using regular factors, irregular factors and trends. Data characteristic analysis is conducted to identify the complexity of different components of the time series. It is important for a multiscale model to select an appropriate model to produce the optimal forecasts. Thus, the final forecasted values are generated by reconstituting all these forecasting items. By investigating the West Texas Intermediate and Brent crude oil prices, this paper presents how data characteristic identification and analysis are conducted in a multiscale paradigm. The empirical analysis proves that the proposed model can achieve superior forecasting results, which indicates the effectiveness of the multiscale model at forecasting complex time series, especially crude oil prices.;ID: 271733;;;;;;;;;;;0040-1625;;;;;;;;;https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0040162521006144;https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0040162521006144;https://doi.org/10.1016/j.techfore.2021.121181;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;

Yet, green infrastructure, as green roofs, provide multiple ecosystem services, as promoting citizens physical and psychological well-being. With the Coronavirus 19 world pandemic public spaces, like parks and other recreational areas, were closed and most citizens were confined to their dwellings. In this context, the need for outdoor space in the housing environment became more necessary than ever. This study is based on a survey performed to citizens living in 35 different countries to identify their access and value given to existing green areas in the home environment during and after confinement, and their willingness to pay (WTP) for an accessible green roof. Results indicate that 68% of respondents missed having a garden during the confinement and the outdoor space value increased after the confinement. Most are willing to pay for a medium sized accessible green roof and their WTP increases if the green area is bigger. WTP for medium sized green roofs is higher in other countries than in Portugal but not significantly different for larger green roofs. To promote private investment in green roofs, citizens WTP should be considered when designing new urban green infrastructure incentive policies.;ID: 312002;;;;;;;;;;;2352-7102;;;;;;;;;https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S2352710221012468;https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S2352710221012468;https://doi.org/10.1016/j.jobe.2021.103388;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;

However, to our knowledge, there are no antecedents aimed at comparing and classifying avocado fruits. The pulp oil fraction of the avocado fruit was first extracted using pressurised liquid extraction from the previously lyophilised pulp. Then the 190–400 ​nm UV-absorption fingerprints were obtained from the avocado oils using normal phase high performance liquid chromatography coupled to an absorption diode-array detector ((NP)HPLC-DAD) and the 220 ​nm spectra were then selected for classification model building.

The use of state-dependent income elasticities to improve aviation forecasts;Journal of Air Transport Management;;2022;;January 2022;98;;102147;;;This paper explores the causal relationship between income and air travel demand to provide insights for the future growth of the aviation industry, with particular focus on the recovery period after a crisis. Using US data, we estimate the long-run and short-run income elasticities of air passenger demand and we estimate how they vary over the business cycle. We find that long-run income elasticities are lower than short-run elasticities and that the short-run elasticities are lower during the recovery period following an economic downturn. A reduction in income elasticity of demand during the recovery period is consistent with an increase in precautionary savings. We then apply our results to IMF economic forecasts, and our analysis suggests that a return of the air traffic to its pre-crisis levels would be slower that the return of economic activities to their levels. Forecasts using our estimates are likely to be more accurate than one based on constant income elasticities of demand and suggest that air traffic in the US would return to its 2019 level in 2025, which is three years after the recovery of real GDP in this scenario. The use of state dependent income elasticities – in conjunction with other techniques that can control for other likely changes in demand and supply in a post-COVID world – could play an important role in helping to generate better forecasts for the aviation industry.;ID: 271915;;;;;;;;;;;0969-6997;;;;;;;;;https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0969699721001289;https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0969699721001289;https://doi.org/10.1016/j.jairtraman.2021.102147;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;

For this purpose, a new seasonal grey prediction model (AWBO-DGGM(1,1)) is proposed: it combines buffer operators and the DGGM(1,1) model. Based on the quarterly data of the industrial enterprises in Zhejiang Province of China from the first quarter of 2013 to the first quarter of 2020, the GM(1,1), DGGM(1,1), SVM, and AWBO-DGGM(1,1) models are employed, respectively, to simulate and forecast seasonal variations in electricity consumption, the added value, and electricity usage efficiency. The results indicate that the AWBO-DGGM(1,1) models can identify seasonal fluctuations and variations in time series data, and predict the impact of COVID-19 on industrial systems. The minimum mean absolute percentage errors (MAPEs) of the electricity consumption, added value, and electricity usage efficiency of industrial enterprises separately are 0.12%, 0.10%, and 3.01% in the training stage, while those in the test stage are 6.79%, 4.09%, and 2.25%, respectively. The electricity consumption, added value, and electricity usage efficiency of industrial enterprises in Zhejiang Province will still present a tendency to grow with seasonal fluctuations from 2020 to 2022.

A total of 99 valid datasets of odor emissions from a landfill working surface were obtained from in situ monitoring for 9 months. Meteorological parameters (temperature, humidity, atmospheric pressure) and waste properties (contents of protein, lipid, carbohydrate, ash, and moisture) were used to construct artificial neural network (ANN) models for the emission rate prediction of typical compounds. The optimal structures and performance of the ANN models were determined by comparing and training with different structural configurations. The ANN models with genetic algorithm (GA) optimization show better performance than those without GA. With the data distribution of input parameters, the ranges of the emission rates of typical compounds were predicted by combining the established ANN models and the Monte Carlo approach. The sensitivity and uncertainty analyses revealed that temperature, atmospheric pressure, protein and lipid contents are parameters sensitive to emission rates, and meteorological parameters have significant impacts on the uncertainty. The established ANN models for the prediction of emission rates can provide scientific evidence and an approach to assess and control the odor and health risk in waste sectors.;ID: 271837;;;;;;;;;;;0956-053X;;;;;;;;;https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0956053X21006334;https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0956053X21006334;https://doi.org/10.1016/j.wasman.2021.11.045;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;

The need for more accurate and efficient ways to manage blood demand and supply is an increasing concern. Building a technology-based, robust blood demand and supply chain that can achieve the goals of reducing ordering frequency, inventory level, wastage and shortage, while maintaining the safety of blood usage, is essential in modern healthcare systems. In this study, we summarize the key challenges in current demand and supply management for red blood cells (RBCs). We combine ideas from statistical time series modeling, machine learning, and operations research in developing an ordering decision strategy for RBCs, through integrating a hybrid demand forecasting model using clinical predictors and a data-driven multi-period inventory problem considering inventory and reorder constraints. We have applied the integrated ordering strategy to the blood inventory management system in Hamilton, Ontario using a large clinical database from 2008 to 2018. The proposed hybrid demand forecasting model provides robust and accurate predictions, and identifies important clinical predictors for short-term RBC demand forecasting. Compared with the actual historical data, our integrated ordering strategy reduces the inventory level by 40% and decreases the ordering frequency by 60%, with low incidence of shortages and wastage due to expiration. If implemented successfully, our proposed strategy can achieve significant cost savings for healthcare systems and blood suppliers. The proposed ordering strategy is generalizable to other blood products or even other perishable products.;ID: 280863;;;;;;;;;;;2211-6923;;;;;;;;;https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S2211692321000060;https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S2211692321000060;https://doi.org/10.1016/j.orhc.2021.100290;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;

The study employs advanced machine learning, such as the LightGBM, CatBoost, XGBoost, Random Forest (RF), and neural network models. An accurate forecasting framework can effectively capture the trend of the changes in oil prices and reduce the impact of the COVID-19 pandemic on such prices. Additionally, a large dataset with different asset classes was used to investigate the crash period. The research also introduced SHapely Additive exPlanations (SHAP) values for model analysis and interpretability. The empirical results indicate the superiority of the RF and LightGBM over traditional models. Moreover, this new framework provides favorable explanations of the model performance using the efficient SHAP algorithm. It also highlights the core features of predicting oil prices. The study found that high values of GER and ESG lead to lower crude oil prices.

Using longitudinal archival data from 2015 to 2020 and advanced regression analysis, the paper compares post-pandemic electricity production levels to pre-pandemic levels under various post-pandemic lockdown scenarios (ranging from no lockdown to partial and full lockdowns). The results showed a decline in average hourly electricity load during the various post-pandemic periods (compared with pre-pandemic levels) where the magnitude of the decline varied across the hour-of-day and the type of lockdown policy. On average, there was a decline of 9.0% to 14.0% in average hourly load during the post-pandemic period with no curfew policies (compared with pre-pandemic levels). This decline was magnified when lockdown was enforced, leading to a net reduction of up to 16.4%, but only when curfew hours coincided with peak load hours (i.e., from noon to sunset).

The current study forecasts the emissions from the countries' four sectors – Transportation, Building, Waste, and Manufacturing/Construction. By extending the classical discrete grey forecasting model DGM (1, 1), a new data-driven time-series forecasting technique, called DGM (1, 1, α), is proposed and applied to forecast the emissions in these sectors till 2028 with an accuracy of over 95%. The results show that the emissions are generally increasing. However, China continues to show a decline in the emissions from the manufacturing and construction industries. Also, the Posterior-Variance Test is introduced to test whether a given forecasting model is qualified or unqualified for a given problem.

Thus, it is an urgent task to construct an efficient air quality early-warning system to guide public life and production. This paper proposes an innovative air pollution early-warning system, including four main modules: clustering, preprocessing, forecasting and evaluation. In the clustering module, with the aim of building an efficient air pollution warning system, the air pollution situation of 31 provincial capitals is clustered and the study areas of the current study are selected based on the clustering result. A new data preprocessing algorithm is conducted to excavate the potential characteristics of the raw time series in the first place in the preprocessing module. Then, the length-changeable incremental extreme learning machine is used to forecast each component. In the evaluation module, the air quality is qualitatively analyzed by the fuzzy evaluation method. Moreover, the DM test and the SPA test are employed to test the accuracy of the forecasting model. The experimental results of eighteen data sets from three cities show that the hybrid air quality early-warning system establish in the study not only has higher accuracy and generalization ability than other benchmark models, but can provide sufficient air quality information, which is essential to control air pollution.;ID: 313794;;;;;;;;;;;1309-1042;;;;;;;;;https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S1309104221002191;https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S1309104221002191;https://doi.org/10.1016/j.apr.2021.101153;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;

However, long-term dependencies and chaotic properties are still two major issues that lower the performance of state-of-the-art deep learning models in forecasting future price trends. In this study, we propose a novel framework to address both issues. Specifically, in terms of transforming time series into complex networks, we convert market price series into graphs. Then, structural information, referring to temporal point associations and node weights, is extracted from the mapped graphs to resolve the problems regarding long-term dependencies and chaotic properties. We take graph embeddings to represent the associations among temporal points as the prediction model inputs. Node weights are used as a priori knowledge to enhance the learning of temporal attention. The effectiveness of our proposed framework is validated using real-world stock data, and our approach obtains the best performance among several state-of-the-art benchmarks. Moreover, in the conducted trading simulations, our framework further obtains the highest cumulative profits.

The aim was to predict mortality within 96 hours after admission to mirror the clinical situation of patient evaluation after an ICU trial, which consists of 24-48 hours of ICU treatment and then “re-triage”. The input variables were deliberately restricted to ABG values to maximise real-world practicability. Methods : We retrospectively evaluated septic patients in the multi-centre eICU dataset as well as single centre MIMIC-III dataset. Included were all patients alive after 48 hours with available data on ABG (n = 3979 and n = 9655 ICU stays for the multi-centre and single centre respectively). The primary endpoint was 96 -h-mortality. Results : The model was developed using long short-term memory (LSTM), a type of DNN designed to learn temporal dependencies between variables. Input variables were all ABG values within the first 48 hours. The SOFA score (AUC of 0.72) was moderately predictive. Logistic regression showed good performance (AUC of 0.82). The best performance was achieved by the LSTM-based model with AUC of 0.88 in the multi-centre study and AUC of 0.85 in the single centre study.

Infectious disease outbreaks such as COVID-19 can also significantly affect the sustainable development of urban areas. Several factors such as population density and climatology parameters could potentially affect the spread of the COVID-19. In this study, a combination of the virus optimization algorithm (VOA) and adaptive network-based fuzzy inference system (ANFIS) was used to investigate the effects of various climate-related factors and population density on the spread of the COVID-19. For this purpose, data on the climate-related factors and the confirmed infected cases by the COVID-19 across the U.S counties was used. The results show that the variable defined for the population density had the most significant impact on the performance of the developed models, which is an indication of the importance of social distancing in reducing the infection rate and spread rate of the COVID-19. Among the climatology parameters, an increase in the maximum temperature was found to slightly reduce the infection rate. Average temperature, minimum temperature, precipitation, and average wind speed were not found to significantly affect the spread of the COVID-19 while an increase in the relative humidity was found to slightly increase the infection rate. The findings of this research show that it could be expected to have slightly reduced infection rate over the summer season. However, it should be noted that the models developed in this study were based on limited one-month data.

In China and many other nations, universities have introduced compulsory remote education programs such as mobile learning (m-learning) to prevent public health hazards caused by the pandemic. However, so far, there is still a lack of understanding of student’s learning experience responses in compulsory m-learning programs. As such, there is a necessity to explore the factors and mechanisms which drives students’ experience. This paper evaluates the influence of both pedagogy and technology on learner’s compulsory m-learning experience response (ER) by extending the mobile technology acceptance model (MTAM) during the COVID-19 pandemic. An online self-administered questionnaire was used to collect the data, which was then analysed through SmartPLS 3.2.9. Importance-performance matrix analysis was applied as a post-hoc procedure to gauge the importance and performance of the exogenous constructs. The results revealed that perceptions of m-learning’s learning content quality, user interface, and system’s connectivity affect the perceived mobile usefulness and easiness which in turn affects ER. This paper validates MTAM in the field of education by integrating MTAM with pedagogy and technology attributes under a social emergency setting such as the COVID-19 pandemic. In addition, the current research explains users' ER rather than behaviour intention which is commonly adopted in past studies.;ID: 271579;;;;;;;;;;;0736-5853;;;;;;;;;https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0736585321001155;https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0736585321001155;https://doi.org/10.1016/j.tele.2021.101676;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;

The results indicate that the most effective individuals factors on active travel are bicycle and car ownership, and built environment characteristics are walkability, bikeability, security, aesthetics, traffic calming, intersections safety, land uses diversity and density, destination accessibility, street pattern, and bike-sharing infrastructures. Also, the average walking and cycling time of the CBD residents before and after the outbreak is more than that of the non-CBD residents, which is due to the quality of built environment factors in the CBD. A built environment with mixed, diverse, dense and accessible land uses, as well as safe and secure cycling and walking routes have major effects on active travel in the crisis.

This disease affects the respiratory system, and the viral agent that causes it, SARS-CoV-2, spreads through droplets of saliva, as well as through coughing and sneezing. As an extremely transmissible viral infection, COVID-19 is causing significant damage to the economies of both developed and lower- and middle-income countries because of its direct impact on the health of citizens and the containment measures taken to curtail the virus. Methods to reduce or control the spread of the virus and protect the global population are needed to avoid further deaths, long-term health issues, and prolonged economic impact. The most effective approach to reduce viral spread and avoid a substantial collapse of the health system, in the absence of vaccines, is nonpharmaceutical interventions (NPI) such as enforcing social containment restrictions, monitoring overall population mobility, implementing widespread viral testing, and increasing hygiene measures. Our approach consists of combining network analytics with machine learning models by using a combination of anonymized health and telecommunications data to better understand the correlation between population movements and virus spread. This approach, called location network analysis (LNA), allows for accurate prediction of possible new outbreaks. It gives governments and health authorities a crucial tool that can help define more accurate public health metrics and can be used either to intensify social containment policies to avoid further spread or to ease them to reopen the economy. LNA can also help to retrospectively evaluate the effectiveness of policy responses to COVID-19.;ID: 305627;;;;;;;;;;;2214-5796;;;;;;;;;https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S2214579621000599;https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S2214579621000599;https://doi.org/10.1016/j.bdr.2021.100242;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;

Such a high share results in an increasing need for flexibility measures such as international transmission flexibility, i.e., electricity imports and exports. In fact, during the COVID-19 pandemic, Germany changed from a former electricity net exporter to a net importer. This paper, therefore, analyzes what we can learn from the resulting development of German electricity imports as a flexibility measure from a market, environmental, and network perspective. We analyze data on electricity imports/exports, generation, prices, and interconnection capacities of 38 bidding zones, respectively 11 countries within the ENTSO-E. In particular, we formulate three hypotheses to partition our overarching research question. Our results reveal that from a market perspective, Germany's increased need for transmission flexibility did not generally result in increased prices for German electricity imports. Also, from an environmental perspective, Germany increasingly relied on electricity imports from countries that exhibited a lower share of renewables. Finally, during the COVID-19 pandemic some of Germany's interconnection capacities to its neighboring countries exhibited a higher utilization. In view of our results, German policymakers may reflect on decarbonization policies considering a holistic European perspective.;ID: 271090;;;;;;;;;;;0360-5442;;;;;;;;;https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0360544222002067;https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0360544222002067;https://doi.org/10.1016/j.energy.2022.123303;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;

TAM is used to locate factors influencing the adoption of the smartwatch (ASW). Most importantly, the current study focuses on factors influencing smartwatch acceptance and use in the medical area, facilitating and enhancing the effective role of doctors and patients. The present study's conceptual framework examines the close association between two-term TAM variables of perceived ease of use (PEU) and perceived usefulness (PU) and the constructs of user satisfaction and content richness. It also incorporates the flow theory (EXP) to measure the effectiveness of the smartwatch. The study also uses the flow theory to assess involvement and control over ASW. The study used a sample of 489 respondents from the medical field, including doctors, nurses, and patients. The study employed a hybrid analysis method combining Structural Equation Modeling (SEM) and an Artificial Neural Network (ANN) based on deep learning. The study also used Importance-Performance Map Analysis (IPMA) to determine the relevance and performance of the variables influencing ASW. Based on the ANN and IPMA analyses, user satisfaction is the most crucial predictor of intention to use a medical smartwatch. Applying the structural equation model to the sample shows that SAT, PU, PEU, and EXP significantly influence intention to use a medical smartwatch. The study also revealed that content richness is an important factor that enhances users' PU. The current study could enable healthcare provider practitioners and decision-makers to identify factors for prioritisation and to strategise their policies accordingly. Methodologically, this study indicates that a “deep ANN architecture” can determine the non-linear associations between variables in the theoretical model.

However, the impact of lockdowns and shutdowns on the power system in different regions as well as periods of the pandemic can hardly be reflected on the foundation of current studies. In this paper, a prediction-based analysis method is developed to point out the electricity consumption gap resulted from the pandemic situation. The core of this method is a novel optimized grey prediction model, namely Rolling IMSGM(1,1) (Rolling Mechanism combined with grey model with initial condition as Maclaurin series), which achieves better prediction results in the face of long-term emergencies. A novel initial condition is adopted to track data with various characteristics in the form of higher-order polynomials, which are then determined by intelligent algorithms to realize accurate fitting. Historical power consumption data in China are utilized to carry out the monthly forecasts during COVID-19. Compared with other competitive models’ prediction results, the superiority of IMSGM(1,1) are demonstrated. Through analyzing the gap between predicted consumption values and the actual data, it can be found that the impact of the pandemic on electricity varies in different periods, which is related to its severity and the local lockdown policies. This study helps to understand the impact on power industry in the face of such an emergency intuitively so as to respond to possible future events.;ID: 271429;;;;;;;;;;;0306-2619;;;;;;;;;https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0306261920317219;https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0306261920317219;https://doi.org/10.1016/j.apenergy.2020.116339;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;

The accurate prediction of carbon prices is an active topic of research. However, many previous studies have focused on the application of a single model, ignoring the application of combination strategies. In this study, a hybrid forecasting system that includes error correction strategy and divide-conquer strategy is designed to predict the carbon price series accurately. Specifically, the main framework of this article comprises four modules. Data preprocessing module of the divide and conquer strategy is proposed. Next, the optimization module uses a multi-objective grasshopper optimization algorithm to enhance the performance of the prediction module. Then, the error correction module predicts the error sequence and corrects the model results. To verify the performance of the established hybrid forecasting system, experiments were performed using two real carbon price series from China and European Union emissions trading schemes, and the results showed that the mean absolute percentage errors of the system were 2.7793% and 0.6720%, respectively, which are better than the other benchmark methods considered.

However, it is a challenging task to establish an efficient forecasting model for enhancing the forecasting accuracy, accelerating the forecasting speed, minimizing the electricity consumption and reducing the environmental pollution. Most existing works on the residential electricity consumption focus on improving the forecasting accuracy while the improvement is insufficient. And few of them have considered the forecasting speed. To overcome these limitations, this paper firstly proposes a hybrid Improved Whale Optimization Algorithm - Optimized Grey Seasonal Variation Index (IWOA-OGSVI) model for best solutions of satisfactory forecasting results with high accuracy and fast-convergence. Next, for evaluating the forecasting performance, two case studies are carried out to estimate the effectiveness of our proposed model compared with a range of benchmark models. Finally, the empirical results present that the MAPE values in our proposed model are smallest at the “Excellent” level of the forecasting power and all of them have converged before 30 iterations, which demonstrate the superiority of our proposed model over the others on the forecasting accuracy and speed among the five selected regions.;ID: 271090;;;;;;;;;;;0360-5442;;;;;;;;;https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S036054422101375X;https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S036054422101375X;https://doi.org/10.1016/j.energy.2021.121127;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;

Two drivers of the cost of TKAs are duration of surgery (DOS) and postoperative inpatient length of stay (LOS). The ability to predict TKA DOS and LOS has substantial implications for hospital finances, scheduling, and resource allocation. The goal of this study was to predict DOS and LOS for elective unilateral TKAs using machine learning models (MLMs) based on preoperative factors. Methods The American College of Surgeons (ACS) National Surgical and Quality Improvement (NSQIP) database was queried for unilateral TKAs from 2014 to 2019. The dataset was split into training, validation, and testing based on year. Models (linear, tree-based, and multilayer perceptron (MLP)) were fitted to the training set in scikit-learn and PyTorch, with hyperparameters tuned on the validation set. The models were trained to minimize the mean squared error (MSE). Models with the best performance on the validation set were evaluated on the testing set according to 1) MSE, 2) buffer accuracy, and 3) classification accuracy, with results compared to a mean regressor. Results A total of 302,300 patients were included in this study. During validation, the PyTorch MLPs had the best MSEs for DOS (0.918) and LOS (0.715). During testing, the PyTorch MLPs similarly performed best based on MSEs for DOS (0.896) and LOS (0.690). While the scikit-learn MLP yielded the best 30-minute buffer accuracy for DOS (78.8%), the PyTorch MLP provided the best 1-day buffer accuracy for LOS (75.2%). Nearly all the ML models were more accurate than the mean regressors for both DOS and LOS. Conclusion Conventional and deep learning models performed better than mean regressors for predicting DOS and LOS of unilateral elective TKA patients based on preoperative factors. Future work should include operational factors to improve overall predictions.;ID: 271161;;;;;;;;;;;1386-5056;;;;;;;;;https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S1386505621002963;https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S1386505621002963;https://doi.org/10.1016/j.ijmedinf.2021.104670;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;

This provides an opportunity to quantify the contribution rate of road traffic to PM2.5 and NO2 concentrations. This paper creatively puts forward the concept of the Maximum Possible Contribution Rate (MPCR) and estimates the MPCR of road traffic to PM2.5 and NO2 by analyzing the daily air pollution data and road traffic data in Beijing from January 24 to March 31, 2020 and the same period in 2019. The findings of this paper include: The decrease in SO2 concentration during the lockdown indicates a reduction in pollutant emissions from industry and households. During the lockdown, road traffic in Beijing reduced by 46.9 %, while the concentrations of PM2.5 and NO2 in the atmosphere reduced by 5.6 % and 29.2 % respectively. The MPCR of road traffic to PM2.5 and NO2 concentrations are 11.9 % and 62.3 %, respectively. The concentration of O3 did not increase significantly with the decrease of PM2.5 and NO2 concentrations.

First, we analyse structural similarity and anomalies in the trajectories of cases and deaths as multivariate time series. Next, we study the lengths of the different waves of the virus outbreaks across the three countries and their states. Finally, we investigate suitable time offsets between cases and deaths as a function of the distinct outbreak waves.

Nevertheless, in these systems, two major problems arise. One is the imbalance of free-floating shared bikes (FFSB) between zones due to one-way trips, the other is the damaged bikes that must be brought for repair. In this study, a modeling framework for dynamic relocating operational and damaged bikes is proposed that starts with predicting the number and location of shared bikes using deep learning algorithms. The demand forecasting model adopts the Encoder-Decoder architecture embedded with the attention mechanism to further enhance the model’s prediction ability and flexibility. Then, a data-driven optimization model for FFSB relocations is presented, where the multi-period optimization is applied to dynamically plan the relocation activities throughout the day. A new hybrid metaheuristic algorithm that incorporates variable neighborhood search (VNS) and enhanced simulated annealing (ESA) algorithm is developed for solving the relocating problem, in which satisfactory performance is observed from the numerical example. We test the proposed framework with the real-world FFSB data from Beijing, China. The results show that relocating both operational and damaged bikes timely decreases the probability of users finding damaged bikes in the system, but leads to higher relocation costs. For peak-hours, considering only the operational bikes for relocation is the most effective strategy given the limited relocation resources. It is urgent at those times of the day to focus on providing bikes to clients where they are undersupplied.;ID: 271795;;;;;;;;;;;0965-8564;;;;;;;;;https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0965856421002408;https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0965856421002408;https://doi.org/10.1016/j.tra.2021.09.010;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;

Different analyses propose models to predict the evolution of this epidemic. These analyses propose models for specific geographical areas, specific countries, or create a global model. The models give us the possibility to predict the virus behavior, it could be used to make future response plans. This work presents an analysis of COVID-19 spread that shows a different angle for the whole world, through 6 geographic regions (continents). We propose to create a relationship between the countries, which are in the same geographical area to predict the advance of the virus. The countries in the same geographic region have variables with similar values (quantifiable and non-quantifiable), which affect the spread of the virus. We propose an algorithm to performed and evaluated the ARIMA model for 145 countries, which are distributed into 6 regions. Then, we construct a model for these regions using the ARIMA parameters, the population per 1M people, the number of cases, and polynomial functions. The proposal is able to predict the COVID-19 cases with a RMSE average of 144.81. The main outcome of this paper is showing a relation between COVID-19 behavior and population in a region, these results show us the opportunity to create more models to predict the COVID-19 behavior using variables as humidity, climate, culture, among others.;ID: 272229;;;;;;;;;;;1568-4946;;;;;;;;;https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S1568494620305482;https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S1568494620305482;https://doi.org/10.1016/j.asoc.2020.106610;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;

Our analysis considered sustainability variables (social, environmental, and economic) to investigate the pandemic's effects on the ethanol industries of 15 ethanol producing Brazilian states, comparing data from 2020 to 2019 and applying a novel Data Envelopment Analysis (DEA): the Double Frontier Slack-Based Measure Malmquist Productivity Index (DF-SBM MPI). The findings show that all states suffered negative impacts from the pandemic and some incurred a risk of collapsing it. The least negatively impacted states were São Paulo and Mato Grosso. São Paulo's ethanol sector is a benchmark for income derived from trade in carbon-credits by RenovaBio certified mills, while Mato Grosso's sector is able to take advantage of the largest spread between ethanol and gasoline prices, certainly a competitive advantage for ethanol producers. We recommend the implementation of public policies to support, mainly, the most affected states by assisting their mills to become environmentally certified participants to take advantage of income opportunities available in the carbon-credit trading market. We recommend, among other actions, a temporary ethanol sales tax reduction, an extension of debt repayment schedules, and stimulating an increase in the fleet of flex-fuel vehicles.;ID: 276821;;;;;;;;;;;0739-8859;;;;;;;;;https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0739885921001098;https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0739885921001098;https://doi.org/10.1016/j.retrec.2021.101137;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;

While one of the aspects of a pandemic is the loss of human life, the outbreak has multi-dimensional impacts across regional and global societies. In this paper, a comparative regressive and neural network model is developed to analyze the impacts of COVID-19 (coronavirus) on the electricity and petroleum demand in China. The environmental analysis shows that the epidemic severeness significantly affects the electricity and the petroleum demand, both directly and indirectly. The outputs of the model stated that the elasticity of petroleum and electricity demand toward the population of the infected people is −0.1% and −0.65%, respectively.

Owing to the stochastic and intermittent nature of wind power, the conventional methods no longer ensure sufficient accuracy of wind power prediction in majority of scenarios. Motivated by recent advancements of ensemble methods based on decomposition technologies, a novel ensemble method based on ensemble empirical mode decomposition (EEMD) and least absolute shrinkage and selection operator–quantile regression neural network (LASSO–QRNN) model for forecasting wind power is proposed in this paper. The model is an ingenious integration of data preprocessing technology, feature selection method, prediction model and data post-processing technology. Thereinto, EEMD is exploited to convert intricate and irregular wind power time series into a collection of subseries relatively easy to analyze; LASSO regression is combined with QRNN model to realize the filtering of important variables and provide more comprehensive and robust prediction results; the KDE method reprocesses the prediction results, greatly improves the prediction accuracy and effectively quantifies the uncertainty of the forecasting process. The suggested model and several benchmark models have been implemented on six wind power datasets, two are gathered from a wind farm in Spain and four from a competition to demonstrate the superiorities of the model proposed in this paper.

To decrease the complexity of EC predictions, applying a novel three-layer decomposition approach to decompose a complex series into a trend sub-series and several simpler non-trend sub-series. Since the trend sub-series describes the developing tendency that is determined by the primarily influencing factors on EC, it is predicted by multivariate linear regression (MLR). In view of its learning ability of nonlinear mappings and excellent performance in dealing with long term dependency, long short-term memory neural network (LSTM) is applied to predict non-trend sub-series. Then, the final EC prediction is solved by calculating the sum of all these sub-series prediction values. A novel EC forecasting model based on machine learning with three-layer decomposition-ensemble approach is proposed in this study. Compared with traditional decomposition approaches (trend decomposition (TD), wavelet decomposition (WD), empirical mode decomposition (EMD), TD-EMD and TD-WD), the proposed three-layer decomposition approach can improve the prediction performance by combining the advantages of TD, EMD and WD. The proposed forecasting model is validated by empirical studies using the EC data of China and U.S. Finally, this study gives the China’s EC prediction in 2020–2024.;ID: 311225;;;;;;;;;;;2352-4847;;;;;;;;;https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S235248472100706X;https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S235248472100706X;https://doi.org/10.1016/j.egyr.2021.08.103;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;

This study proposed and applied novel time fractional derivative models (FDMs) to quantify the spatiotemporal dynamics of the COVID-19 pandemic spreading in the states of Alabama and New York, U.S., two states with quite different population compositions, urbanization, and industry structures. Model applications revealed that the pandemic evolving in the two states exhibited an overall similar time-dependent trend with subtle differences in propagation rates. Alabama may have more inter-county communications in rural areas than urban areas, while the opposite may be true for the New York State. Further analysis using the space FDM showed that the COVID-19 pandemic spread in rural/urban areas of the two states by following the tempered stable density distributions with different indexes, while the number of the state’s pandemic epicenters affected the pattern of the COVID-19 pandemic spreading in space. Finally, applications of a novel time FDM revealed that the evolution of the economy, represented by the weekly unemployment insurance claims in the two states, exhibited different spreading and recovery rates, most likely due to their different exposures and responses to the pandemic. Therefore, COVID-19 spreading dynamics exhibited strong and subtly different spatiotemporal memories in rural and urban areas in the Alabama and New York States, motivating the application of FDMs.;ID: 280687;;;;;;;;;;;2211-3797;;;;;;;;;https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S221137972100485X;https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S221137972100485X;https://doi.org/10.1016/j.rinp.2021.104360;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;

Heart rate variability (HRV) has been shown to be reflective of stress and burnout. The present study evaluated the prevalence of burnout and attempted to develop a HRV based predictive machine learning (ML) model to detect burnout among HCWs during COVID-19 pandemic. Methods Mini-Z 1.0 survey was collected from 1615 HCWs, of whom 664, 512 and 439 were frontline, second-line and non-COVID HCWs respectively. Burnout was defined as score ≥3 on Mini-Z-burnout-item. A 12-lead digitized ECG recording was performed and ECG features of HRV were obtained using feature extraction. A ML model comprising demographic and HRV features was developed to detect burnout. Results Burnout rates were higher among second-line workers 20.5% than frontline 14.9% and non-COVID 13.2% workers. In multivariable analyses, features associated with higher likelihood of burnout were feeling stressed (OR = 6.02), feeling dissatisfied with current job (OR = 5.15), working in a chaotic, hectic environment (OR = 2.09) and feeling that COVID has significantly impacted the mental wellbeing (OR = 6.02). HCWs with burnout had a significantly lower HRV parameters like root mean square of successive RR intervals differences (RMSSD) [p < 0.0001] and standard deviation of the time interval between successive RR intervals (SDNN) [p < 0.001]) as compared to normal subjects. Extra tree classifier was the best performing ML model (sensitivity: 84%) Conclusion In this study of HCWs from India, burnout prevalence was lower than reports from developed nations, and was higher among second-line versus frontline workers.

Q.";A novel grey multivariate model for forecasting landslide displacement;Engineering Applications of Artificial Intelligence;Eng Appl Artif Intell;2021;;aug-21;103;;104297;;;Forecasting landslide displacement is an important issue in engineering geology. In this field, it is difficult to accurately forecast the displacement of the step point of a step-type landslide. In this study, a novel grey multivariate model is proposed for forecasting landslide displacement. The proposed model transforms the original sequence by using the Hausdorff derivative operator, determines the model parameters by using the particle swarm optimization algorithm, and uses the trapezoidal integral formula to calculate the predicted value. Two numerical examples show that the average absolute relative error and mean squared error of the proposed model are smaller than those of the recursive discrete multivariate grey model and the multivariable grey model with structure compatibility. The proposed model is used to forecast the displacement of the Bazimen landslide in the Three Gorges Reservoir area of China. The previous month’s displacement, precipitation, and change in the reservoir water level are used as input variables. The results show that the performance of the proposed model is superior to that of the extreme learning machine model.

The forecasting results can assist the decision-making process, providing useful projections to specialists. In this paper, a hybrid approach named Parallel Recursive Singular Spectrum Analysis and Evolving Neuro-Fuzzy Network (PRSSA+ENFN) for forecasting univariate and multivariate experimental time series, with learning from data streams composed of time series samples, is presented. The adopted methodology considers an evolving neuro-fuzzy basis, i.e., the PRSSA+ENFN adapts, extends, and evolves the fuzzy rule structure from new incoming data of the time series. The time series is subdivided into unobservable components, which are patterns contained in the data, and the neuro-fuzzy network forecasts these component samples so to reconstruct the original time series considering future values. An alternative to determine the specific parameters of PRSSA+ENFN is the application of a genetic algorithm. Four multi-steps ahead forecasting experiments are outlined with univariate and multivariate time series.

However, most empirical studies failed to investigate its effects on the prices of food and healthcare services, which by all standards, are essential commodities. On this background, this study evaluates the impact of COVID-19 reported cases and lockdown stringency measures on the food and healthcare prices in the six (6) worst-affected countries. For empirical purposes, daily prices of food and healthcare services between 22nd January and 31st December 2020 were regressed against daily cases of COVID-19 and lockdown stringency measures within the dynamic autoregressive distributed lag procedure. Empirical evidences reveal that prices of healthcare and food are cointegrated with COVID-19 cases and lockdown measures in all the selected countries except Italy. Equally, healthcare and food prices reinforced itself in the long-run in the US, the UK and France. Furthermore, COVID-19 cases lead to significant increases in food and healthcare prices in the US, whereas, food and healthcare prices in France and UK declined significantly as COVID-19 cases mount. Conversely, food and healthcare prices declined significantly in the US and soar in France and the UK in reactions to COVID-19 new cases. Likewise, government stringency measures and containment health measures contributed significantly to healthcare and food price hike in the US and France respectively.

The so-obtained regressor method may have better accuracy than its components, but at the same time it may overfit, it may be distorted by base regressors with low accuracy, and it may be too complex to understand and explain. This paper proposes and studies a novel Mathematical Optimization model to build a sparse ensemble, which trades off the accuracy of the ensemble and the number of base regressors used. The latter is controlled by means of a regularization term that penalizes regressors with a poor individual performance. Our approach is flexible to incorporate desirable properties one may have on the ensemble, such as controlling the performance of the ensemble in critical groups of records, or the costs associated with the base regressors involved in the ensemble.

With an EU targeted recycling rate (55%) in 2030, the environmental impacts would still be higher than in 2018, especially global warming potential and plastic marine pollution. This result highlights the importance of plastic waste reduction, especially for the clustering algorithm-based grouped countries with a high amount of untreated plastic waste per capita. Compared to the other assessed scenarios, Scenario 4 with waste reduction (50% recycling, 47.6% energy recovery, 2.4% landfill) shows the lowest impact in acidification, eutrophication, marine aquatic toxicity, plastic marine pollution, and abiotic depletion. However, the global warming potential (8.78 Gt CO2eq) is higher than that in 2018, while Scenario 3 (55% recycling, 42.6% energy recovery, 2.4% landfill) is better in this aspect than Scenario 4. This comprehensive analysis provides pertinent insights into policy interventions towards environmental hazard mitigation.;ID: 271390;;;;;;;;;;;0304-3894;;;;;;;;;https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0304389421022986;https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0304389421022986;https://doi.org/10.1016/j.jhazmat.2021.127330;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;

To improve prediction accuracy of cumulative COVID-19 confirmed data, a new hybrid prediction model based on gradient-based optimizer variational mode decomposition (GVMD), extreme learning machine (ELM), and autoregressive integrated moving average (ARIMA), named GVMD-ELM-ARIMA, is proposed. To solve the problem of selecting the k value and the penalty factor α in variational mode decomposition (VMD), this paper proposes gradient-based optimizer variational mode decomposition (GVMD), which realizes the self-adaptive determination of k value and α value. Firstly, GVMD decomposes the cumulative COVID-19 confirmed data into some intrinsic mode functions (IMFs) and a residual component (IMFr). Secondly, IMFs are predicted by ELM. Then, IMFr is predicted by ARIMA. Finally, the final prediction results are obtained by reconstructing the prediction result of IMFs and IMFr. The cumulative COVID-19 confirmed data of the United States, India and Russia is used to verify its effectiveness. Taking the United States as an example, compared with the average MAPE, RMSE and MAE of the single model, the average MAPE of the hybrid model is reduced by 47.27%, the average RMSE is reduced by 44.50%, and the average MAE is reduced by 55.34%. Compared with GVMD-ELM-ELM, GVMD-ELM-ARIMA proposed in this paper reduces the MAPE by 60%, the RMSE by 56.85%, and the MAE by 61.61%. The experimental results show that GVMD-ELM-ARIMA has best prediction accuracy, and it provides a new method for predicting the cumulative COVID-19 confirmed data.;ID: 276831;;;;;;;;;;;0957-5820;;;;;;;;;https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0957582021005917;https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0957582021005917;https://doi.org/10.1016/j.psep.2021.10.047;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;

However, previous studies have built these hybrid models in a form of a first-order GARCH(1,1) process by following general use for GARCH models. But the way of estimating parameters for GARCH and machine learning models differs considerably. Hence, we have investigated the effect of different model orders of the GARCH process on the volatility forecasts of Bitcoin obtained by the four most used machine learning models. Furthermore, we have proposed a stacking ensemble methodology based on GARCH hybrid models to improve the results further. The proposed stacking ensemble methodology utilizes the techniques of feature selection and feature extraction to reduce the dimension of the predictors before meta-learning. The results show that using higher model orders increases the accuracy of volatility forecasts for hybrid GARCH models. Also, the proposed stacking ensemble with LASSO produces forecasts superior to almost all hybrid models and better than the ordinary stacking ensemble.;ID: 271506;;;;;;;;;;;0957-4174;;;;;;;;;https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0957417421001883;https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0957417421001883;https://doi.org/10.1016/j.eswa.2021.114747;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;

The sectoral average production time of various sectors is evaluated based on the turnover rate data of 3394 listed companies in China’s A-share market. Then, a polynomial function is developed to fit the indirect carbon emissions and time lag at each consumption stage in the industrial chains. Finally, an empirical study is carried out to forecast the time lag effect of carbon emissions with final demand fluctuations based on the latest 2017 input-output table for China. The results show that indirect carbon emissions caused by sectoral economic activities decline stage by stage in the industrial chains, and the decline rate and time lag intensity vary significantly among sectors. The logistics industry has the highest spread efficiency for indirect carbon emissions in the industrial chains, and the construction industry is the first industry affected by the indirect carbon emissions caused by the manufacturing industry. The power/thermal industry’s impact on China’s carbon emissions is the fastest, but its duration is the shortest, while the impact of the manufacturing and mining industries are more stable and durable. However, considering the fluctuations in final demand, the manufacturing industry has replaced the power/thermal industry as the most important industry affecting the time lag effect of China’s carbon emissions.

However, for the traditional SDs forecast model, the interactions between system variables are not considered, resulting in that it may be invalid in the carbon-neutral situation where the inter-relationship between system variables is complex. Moreover, the electricity consumption of various industries is only simply superimposed in the traditional SDs model. This also leads to that the changes of future electricity consumption cannot be understood and grasped as a whole. Thus, a long-term load forecasting method involving carbon-neutral situation is proposed in the current work. First, a new system of influencing factors for electricity consumption containing carbon-neutral factors is constructed. Then, based on the information feedback mechanism, a new SDs forecast model is established, which can more accurately reflect the interaction of system variables. In addition, an electricity consumption identity is also developed to reveal the quantitative relationship between factors, electricity consumption, and carbon emissions at a holistic level. Finally, the evolution process of electricity consumption under various carbon-neutral scenarios is forecasted based on the new established forecast model. Correspondingly, the forecast results are expected to guide power system planning in the future carbon-neutral situation.;ID: 271090;;;;;;;;;;;0360-5442;;;;;;;;;https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0360544221028218;https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0360544221028218;https://doi.org/10.1016/j.energy.2021.122572;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;

Because of these factors, electricity price forecasting is challenging. This paper proposes a scenario modeling approach to improve forecasting accuracy, conditioning time series generative adversarial networks on external factors. After data pre-processing and condition selection, a conditional TSGAN or CTSGAN is designed to forecast electricity prices. Wasserstein Distance, weights limitation, and RMSProp optimizer are used to ensure that the CTGAN training process is stable. By changing the dimensionality of random noise input, the point forecasting model can be transformed into a probabilistic forecasting model. For electricity price point forecasting, the proposed CTSGAN model has better accuracy and has better generalization ability than the TSGAN and other deep learning methods. For probabilistic forecasting, the proposed CTSGAN model can significantly improve the continuously ranked probability score and Winkler score. The effectiveness and superiority of the proposed CTSGAN forecasting model are verified by case studies.;ID: 271429;;;;;;;;;;;0306-2619;;;;;;;;;https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0306261921015555;https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0306261921015555;https://doi.org/10.1016/j.apenergy.2021.118296;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;

On 7th May 2020, self-polymerization runaway reaction from an atmospheric storage tank in a polymer facility triggered the release of styrene to the atmosphere, resulting in 12 fatalities and hospitalization of more than 1000 individuals. A similar incident had happened 35 years back at Bhopal involving the release of methyl isocyanate resulting in one of the deadliest process safety incidents to date. Therefore, it is very important to understand the causal factors so that such high-risk incidents can be prevented in future. This paper presents a comprehensive investigative study of styrene gas leak at Vizag with special emphasis on probabilistic risk analysis of the loss of containment. Hazard perception study was performed to understand the possible hazardous scenarios in bulk styrene storage facilities for preventing such catastrophic recurrences. Energy barrier analysis was performed to study the inadequacy of pro-active and reactive barriers with respect to the accident case study. The analysis also considers the escalation factors resulting from extremities of COVID-19 lockdown. The self-polymerization reaction that resulted in toxic styrene dispersion was preventable owing to the advancements in safety engineering and loss prevention since Bhopal Gas Tragedy (1984). Based on the investigative analysis, it can be pointed out that this accident would have occurred even in the absence of COVID-19 restrictions, mainly due to negligence and complacency shown towards safety by the company’s management.;ID: 276831;;;;;;;;;;;0957-5820;;;;;;;;;https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S095758202100639X;https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S095758202100639X;https://doi.org/10.1016/j.psep.2021.11.034;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;

Many countries have pointed out that electricity supply security during the epidemic is critical to ensuring people’s livelihood. Accurate prediction of electricity demand would act a more important role in ensuring energy security for all the countries. Although there have been many studies on electricity forecasting, they did not consider the pandemic, and many works only considered the prediction accuracy and ignored the stability. Driven by the above reasons, it is necessary to develop an electricity consumption prediction model that can be well applied in the pandemic. In this work, a hybrid prediction system is proposed with data processing, modelling, and optimization. An improved complete ensemble empirical mode decomposition with adaptive noise is used for data preprocessing, which overcomes the shortcomings of the original method; a multi-objective optimizer is adopted for ensuring the accuracy and stability; support vector machine is used as the prediction model. Taking daily electricity demand of US as an example, the results prove that the proposed hybrid models are superior to benchmark models in both prediction accuracy and stability.

Journal Article;RefID:723-hasan2022multi-method;"Hasan,Najmul;Bao,Yukun;Chiong,Raymond";A multi-method analytical approach to predicting young adults’ intention to invest in mHealth during the COVID-19 pandemic;Telematics and Informatics;Telematics Inf.;2022;;March 2022;68;;101765;;;Mobile-based health (mHealth) systems are proving to be a popular alternative to the traditional visits to healthcare providers. They can also be useful and effective in fighting the spread of infectious diseases, such as the COVID-19 pandemic. Even though young adults are the most prevalent mHealth user group, the relevant literature has overlooked their intention to invest in and use mHealth services. This study aims to investigate the predictors that influence young adults’ intention to invest in mHealth (IINmH), particularly during the COVID-19 crisis, by designing a research methodology that incorporates both the health belief model (HBM) and the expectation-confirmation model (ECM). As an expansion of the integrated HBM-ECM model, this study proposes two additional predictors: mobile Internet speed and mobile Internet cost. A multi-method analytical approach, including partial least squares structural equation modelling (PLS-SEM), fuzzy-set qualitative comparative analysis (fsQCA), and machine learning (ML), was utilised together with a sample dataset of 558 respondents. The dataset—about young adults in Bangladesh with an experience of using mHealth—was obtained through a structured questionnaire to examine the complex causal relationships of the integrated model. The findings from PLS-SEM indicate that value-for-money, mobile Internet cost, health motivation, and confirmation of services all have a substantial impact on young adults’ IINmH during the COVID-19 pandemic. At the same time, the fsQCA results indicate that a combination of predictors, instead of any individual predictor, had a significant impact on predicting IINmH. Among ML methods, the XGBoost classifier outperformed other classifiers in predicting the IINmH, which was then used to perform sensitivity analysis to determine the relevance of features. We expect this multi-method analytical approach to make a significant contribution to the mHealth domain as well as the broad information systems literature.;ID: 271579;;;;;;;;;;;0736-5853;;;;;;;;;https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0736585321002045;https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0736585321002045;https://doi.org/10.1016/j.tele.2021.101765;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;

Developing efficient short-term forecasting models allow forecasting the number of future cases. In this context, it is possible to develop strategic planning in the public health system to avoid deaths. In this paper, autoregressive integrated moving average (ARIMA), cubist regression (CUBIST), random forest (RF), ridge regression (RIDGE), support vector regression (SVR), and stacking-ensemble learning are evaluated in the task of time series forecasting with one, three, and six-days ahead the COVID-19 cumulative confirmed cases in ten Brazilian states with a high daily incidence. In the stacking-ensemble learning approach, the CUBIST regression, RF, RIDGE, and SVR models are adopted as base-learners and Gaussian process (GP) as meta-learner. The models’ effectiveness is evaluated based on the improvement index, mean absolute error, and symmetric mean absolute percentage error criteria. In most of the cases, the SVR and stacking-ensemble learning reach a better performance regarding adopted criteria than compared models. In general, the developed models can generate accurate forecasting, achieving errors in a range of 0.87%–3.51%, 1.02%–5.63%, and 0.95%–6.90% in one, three, and six-days-ahead, respectively. The ranking of models, from the best to the worst regarding accuracy, in all scenarios is SVR, stacking-ensemble learning, ARIMA, CUBIST, RIDGE, and RF models. The use of evaluated models is recommended to forecasting and monitor the ongoing growth of COVID-19 cases, once these models can assist the managers in the decision-making support systems.;ID: 271591;;;;;;;;;;;0960-0779;;;;;;;;;https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0960077920302538;https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0960077920302538;https://doi.org/10.1016/j.chaos.2020.109853;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;

In this study, a novel, quantitative and uncomplex method for estimating the energy consumption loss due to the pandemic, which was derived from epidemiological data in the beginning stages, is provided; the method bonds a data-driven prediction (LSTM network) of energy consumption due to COVID-19 to an econometric model (ARDL) so that the long- and short-term impact can be synthesized with adequate statistical validation. The results show that energy loss is statistically correlated with the time-changing effective reproductive number (Rt) of the disease, which can be viewed as quantifying confinement intensity and the severity of the earlier stages of the pandemic. We detected a 1.62% decrease in electricity consumption loss caused by each percent decrease in Rt on average. We verify our method by applying it to Germany and 5 U.S. states with various social features and discuss implications and universality.

Power transformer is the major equipment in a power system. In order to ensure the proper functioning of the power grid, an incipient fault occurs in a transformer that needs to be isolated as soon as possible. Therefore, predicting the transformer's incipient faults as early as possible is essential. Dissolved Gas Analysis (DGA) is the most common power transformer fault diagnostic method among the existing methods for identifying incipient faults. It is a reliable and sensitive technique for the identification of a fault condition inside the oil-immersed transformers. For analyzing these gases and interpreting their significance, there are a number of methods developed, such as Roger gas ratio, IEC gas ratio and Duval Triangle, etc. In certain instances, this traditional approach is not diagnostic. This usually happens to those transformers that simultaneously have more than one kind of fault. In order to resolve this drawback, this article suggests an ANN based DGA method for diagnosing the condition of the power transformer. For this work, Seven faults classification has been taken into account with the features extracted from the gases evolved from the insulating oil of the power transformer. Some oil samples obtained from various power transformers have been used to test the ANN. ANN's performance yields comparatively better precision results.;ID: 305927;;;;;;;;;;;2214-7853;;;;;;;;;https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S2214785321012888;https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S2214785321012888;https://doi.org/10.1016/j.matpr.2021.02.206;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;

A number of countries are experiencing new and severe waves of infection. Therefore, the availability of reliable forecasts for the number of cases and deaths in the coming days is of fundamental importance. We propose a simple statistical method for short-term real-time forecasting of the number of Covid-19 cases and fatalities in countries that are latecomers—i.e., countries where cases of the disease started to appear some time after others. In particular, we propose a penalized LASSO regression model with an error correction mechanism to construct a model of a latecomer country in terms of other countries that were at a similar stage of the pandemic some days before. By tracking the number of cases in those countries, we use an adaptive rolling-window scheme to forecast the number of cases and deaths in the latecomer. We apply this methodology to 45 countries and we provide detailed results for four of them: Brazil, Chile, Mexico, and Portugal. We show that the methodology performs very well when compared to alternative methods. These forecasts aim to foster better short-run management of the healthcare system and can be applied not only to countries but also to different regions within a country.

It is possible to distinguish the effects of lock-down induced impacts in the CLAB index and some of its component pollutants during 2020. Nine machine learning and three deep learning algorithms are compared in their abilities to predict CLAB from the meteorological variables on supervised and unseen bases.

However, the infection in China has been successfully controlled although its initial transmission was also nationwide and has caused a serious public health crisis. The analysis on the early-stage COVID-19 transmission in China is worth investigating for its guiding significance on prevention to other countries and regions. In this study, we conducted the experiments from the perspectives of COVID-19 occurrence and intensity. We eliminated unimportant factors from 113 variables and applied four machine learning-based classification and regression models to predict COVID-19 occurrence and intensity, respectively. The influence of each important factor was analysed when applicable. Our optimal model on COVID-19 occurrence prediction presented an accuracy of 91.91% and the best R2 of intensity prediction reached 0.778. Linear regression-based model was identified as unable to fit and predict the intensity, and thus only the variable influence on COVID-19 occurrence can be explained. We found that (1) CO VID-19 was more likely to occur in prosperous cities closer to the epicentre and located on higher altitudes, (2) and the occurrence was higher under extreme weather and high minimum relative humidity.

Late on January, USA confirmed the first patient with COVID-19, who had recently traveled to China, however, an evaluation of states in USA have demonstrated a fatality rate in China (4%) is lower than New York (4.56%), but lower than Michigan (5.69%). Mean estimates and uncertainty bounds for both USA and his cities and other provinces have increased in the last three months, with focus on New York, New Jersey, Michigan, California, Massachusetts, ... (January e April 12th). Besides, we propose a Reduced-Space Gaussian Process Regression model predicts that the epidemic will reach saturation in USA on July 2020. Our findings suggest, new quarantine actions with more restrictions for containment strategies implemented in USA could be successfully, but in a late period, it could generate critical rate infections and death for the next 2 month.;ID: 271591;;;;;;;;;;;0960-0779;;;;;;;;;https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0960077920303234;https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0960077920303234;https://doi.org/10.1016/j.chaos.2020.109924;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;

This study aims to forecast the number of confirmed cases of COVID-19 in Italy, the United Kingdom (UK) and the United States of America (USA). In this study, grey model (GM(1,1)), nonlinear grey Bernoulli model (NGBM(1,1)) and fractional nonlinear grey Bernoulli model (FANGBM(1,1)) are compared for the prediction. Therefore, grey prediction models, especially the fractional accumulated grey model, are used for the first time in this topic and it is believed that this study fills the gap in the literature. This model is applied to predict the data for the period 19/03-22/04/2020 (35 days) and forecast the data for the period 23/04-22/05/2020. The number of cases of COVID-19 in these countries are handled cumulatively. The prediction performance of the models is measured by the calculation of root mean square error (RMSE), mean absolute percentage error (MAPE) and R2 values. It is obtained that FANGBM(1,1) gives the highest prediction performance with having the lowest RMSE and MAPE values and the highest R2 values for these countries. Results show that the cumulative number of cases for Italy, UK and USA is forecasted to be about 233000, 189000 and 1160000, respectively, on May 22, 2020 which corresponds to the average daily rate is 0.80%, 1.19% and 1.13%, respectively, from 22/04/2020 to 22/05/2020. The FANGBM(1,1) presents that the cumulative number of cases of COVID-19 increases at a diminishing rate from 23/04/2020 to 22/05/2020 for these countries.;ID: 271591;;;;;;;;;;;0960-0779;;;;;;;;;https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0960077920303477;https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0960077920303477;https://doi.org/10.1016/j.chaos.2020.109948;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;

Mostly the developed countries have been hit hard, besides the emerging countries like China, India and Brazil. The scientists and the policy makers are in dark with respect to its spread and claiming lives in coming days. Objectives The present study aims to forecast the number of incidences in severely affected seven countries, USA, UK, Italy, Spain, France, China and India, for the period July 12-Septmeber 11, 2020 and compares the forecasted values with the actual values to judge its depth of severity and growth. Method The study uses Box-Jenkins method of forecasting in an Autoregressive Integrated Moving Average (ARIMA) structure on the basis of the daily data published by World Health Organization from January 21st to July 11, 2020. Results It is observed that USA and India are the two countries whose increasing trends will continue in the forecasted period (July 12 to September 11), others except China will face lower number of incidences. China's incidence has come to halt around 80000 in numbers. The growth rates of the number of incidences for all the countries during the forecasted period will be diminishing. The mean difference test results between the forecasted and actual values in level and growth forms show that in the former case, USA, India, UK will face increasing forecast than the actual number but in the latter case, all of the countries will face significantly decreasing growth rates in the forecasted values compared to their actual growth values.;ID: 271591;;;;;;;;;;;0960-0779;;;;;;;;;https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0960077920306445;https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0960077920306445;https://doi.org/10.1016/j.chaos.2020.110248;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;

Considering that artificial neural network models have higher forecasting accuracy than statistical methods, a multilayer artificial neural network model is developed in this paper. This model splits the dataset into two parts: the first with 80% of the observations and the second with 20%. The model then uses the first part to optimize the forecasting accuracy and then applies the optimized parameters to the second part of the dataset to assess the model performance. A forecasting error of less than 2% is achieved by the model during the testing procedure. The forecasted GDP figures show that the April–June quarter of the current year experienced sharp declines in GDP for all countries.

Observing the failures of several COVID-19 forecasting models and the alarming spread of the virus, we seek to use some stable response for forecasting COVID-19, viz., ratios of COVID-19 cases to mortalities, rather than COVID-19 cases or fatalities. A trend of low COVID-19 cases-to-mortality ratios calls for urgent attention: the need for vaccines, for instance. Studies have shown that there are influences of weather parameters on COVID-19; and COVID-19 may have come to stay and could manifest a seasonal outbreak profile similar to other infectious respiratory diseases. In this paper, the influences of some weather, geographical, economic and demographic covariates were evaluated on COVID-19 response based on a series of Granger-causality tests. The effect of four weather parameters, viz., temperature, rainfall, solar irradiation and relative humidity, on daily COVID-19 cases-to-mortality ratios of 36 countries from 5 continents of the world were determined through regression analysis. Regression studies show that these four weather factors impact ratios of COVID-19 cases-to-mortality differently. The most impactful factor is temperature which is positively correlated with COVID-19 cases-to-mortality responses in 24 out of 36 countries. Temperature minimally affects COVID-19 cases-to-mortality ratios in the tropical countries. The most influential weather factor – temperature – was incorporated in training random forest and deep learning models for forecasting the cases-to-mortality rate of COVID-19 in clusters of countries in the world with similar weather conditions. Evaluation of trained forecasting models incorporating temperature features show better performance compared to a similar set of models trained without temperature features. This implies that COVID-19 forecasting models will predict more accurately if temperature features are factored in, especially for temperate countries.";ID: 271591;;;;;;;;;;;0960-0779;;;;;;;;;https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0960077921006949;https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0960077921006949;https://doi.org/10.1016/j.chaos.2021.111340;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;

Daily growing magnitude of confirmed cases of COVID-19 put the whole world humanity at high risk and it has made a pressure on health professionals to get rid of it as soon as possible. So, it becomes necessary to predict the number of upcoming cases in future for the preparation of future plan-of-action and medical set-ups. The present manuscript proposed a hybrid fuzzy time series model for the prediction of upcoming COVID-19 infected cases and deaths in India by using modified fuzzy C-means clustering technique. Proposed model has two phases. In phase-I, modified fuzzy C-means clustering technique is used to form basic intervals with the help of clusters centroid while in phase-II, these intervals are upgraded to form sub-intervals. The proposed model is tested against available COVID-19 data for the measurement of its performance based on mean square error, root mean square error and average forecasting error rate. The novelty of the proposed model lies in the prediction of COVID-19 infected cases and deaths for next coming 31 days. Beside of this, estimation for the approximate number of isolation beds and ICU required has been carried out.

Particularly, CO2 emissions from transportation account for approximately one-quarter of global emissions since 2016. Electric vehicle (EV) is considered an appealing option to address the aforementioned concerns. However, with the growing EV market, issues such as insufficient charging infrastructure to support such ever-increasing demand emerge as well. Effectively forecasting the commercial EV charging demand ensures the reliability and robustness of grid utility in the short term and helps with investment planning and resource allocation for charging infrastructures in the long run. To this end, this article presents a time-series forecasting of the monthly commercial EV charging demand using a deep learning approach-Sequence to Sequence (Seq2Seq). The proposed model is validated by real-world datasets from the State of Utah and the City of Los Angeles. Two prediction targets, namely one-step ahead prediction and multi-step ahead prediction, are tested. Further, the model is benchmarked and compared against other time series and machine learning models. Experiments show that both Seq2seq and long short-term memory (LSTM) generate satisfactory prediction performance for one-step prediction. However, when performing the multi-step prediction, Seq2Seq significantly outperforms other models in terms of various performance metrics, indicating the model’s strong capability for sequential data predictions.;ID: 781266;;;;;;;;;;;1547-2450;;;;;;;;;https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S1547245022003838;https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S1547245022003838;https://doi.org/10.1080/15472450.2021.1966627;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;

This paper proposes an epidemic control framework that policymakers can use as a data-driven decision support tool for setting efficient social distancing targets. The framework addresses three aspects of the COVID-19 pandemic that are related to social distancing or community mobility data: modeling, financial implications, and policy-making. Thus, we explore the COVID-19 pandemic and concurrent economic situation as functions of historical pandemic data and mobility control. This approach allows us to formulate an efficient social distancing policy as a stochastic feedback control problem that minimizes the aggregated risks of disease transmission and economic volatility. We further demonstrate the use of a deep learning algorithm to solve this control problem. Finally, by applying our framework to U.S. data, we empirically examine the efficiency of the U.S. social distancing policy.;ID: 271700;;;;;;;;;;;0377-2217;;;;;;;;;https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0377221721009589;https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0377221721009589;https://doi.org/10.1016/j.ejor.2021.11.012;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;

In the current scenario, the Brazil and the United States of America present a high daily incidence of new cases and deaths. Therefore, it is important to forecast the number of new cases in a time window of one week, once this can help the public health system developing strategic planning to deals with the COVID-19. The application of the forecasting artificial intelligence (AI) models has the potential of deal with dynamical behavior of time-series like of COVID-19. In this paper, Bayesian regression neural network, cubist regression, k-nearest neighbors, quantile random forest, and support vector regression, are used stand-alone, and coupled with the recent pre-processing variational mode decomposition (VMD) employed to decompose the time series into several intrinsic mode functions. All AI techniques are evaluated in the task of time-series forecasting with one, three, and six-days-ahead the cumulative COVID-19 cases in five Brazilian and American states, with a high number of cases up to April 28th, 2020. Previous cumulative COVID-19 cases and exogenous variables as daily temperature and precipitation were employed as inputs for all forecasting models. The models’ effectiveness are evaluated based on the performance criteria. In general, the hybridization of VMD outperformed single forecasting models regarding the accuracy, specifically when the horizon is six-days-ahead, the hybrid VMD–single models achieved better accuracy in 70% of the cases. Regarding the exogenous variables, the importance ranking as predictor variables is, from the upper to the lower, past cases, temperature, and precipitation. Therefore, due to the efficiency of evaluated models to forecasting cumulative COVID-19 cases up to six-days-ahead, the adopted models can be recommended as a promising models for forecasting and be used to assist in the development of public policies to mitigate the effects of COVID-19 outbreak.;ID: 271591;;;;;;;;;;;0960-0779;;;;;;;;;https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0960077920304252;https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0960077920304252;https://doi.org/10.1016/j.chaos.2020.110027;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;

Research Question Can a transparent deep learning (DL) model predict the need for MV in hospitalized patients and those with COVID-19 up to 24 h in advance? Study Design and Methods We trained and externally validated a transparent DL algorithm to predict the future need for MV in hospitalized patients, including those with COVID-19, using commonly available data in electronic health records. Additionally, commonly used clinical criteria (heart rate, oxygen saturation, respiratory rate, Fio2, and pH) were used to assess future need for MV. Performance of the algorithm was evaluated using the area under receiver operating characteristic curve (AUC), sensitivity, specificity, and positive predictive value. Results We obtained data from more than 30,000 ICU patients (including more than 700 patients with COVID-19) from two academic medical centers. The performance of the model with a 24-h prediction horizon at the development and validation sites was comparable (AUC, 0.895 vs 0.882, respectively), providing significant improvement over traditional clinical criteria (P < .001). Prospective validation of the algorithm among patients with COVID-19 yielded AUCs in the range of 0.918 to 0.943. Interpretation A transparent deep learning algorithm improves on traditional clinical criteria to predict the need for MV in hospitalized patients, including in those with COVID-19. Such an algorithm may help clinicians to optimize timing of tracheal intubation, to allocate resources and staff better, and to improve patient care.;ID: 280288;;;;;;;;;;;0012-3692;;;;;;;;;https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0012369220354544;https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0012369220354544;https://doi.org/10.1016/j.chest.2020.12.009;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;

This approach is dependent on the detection and quantification of SARS-CoV-2 RNA in untreated/raw wastewater. However, the quantification of the viral RNA could be influenced by the physico-chemical properties of the wastewater. This study presents the first use of Adaptive Neuro-Fuzzy Inference System (ANFIS) to determine the potential impact of physico-chemical characteristics of wastewater on the detection and concentration of SARS-CoV-2 RNA in wastewater. Raw wastewater samples from four wastewater treatment plants were investigated over four months. The physico-chemical characteristics of the raw wastewater was recorded, and the SARS-CoV-2 RNA concentration determined via amplification with droplet digital polymerase chain reaction. The wastewater characteristics considered were chemical oxygen demand, flow rate, ammonia, pH, permanganate value, and total solids. The mean SARS-CoV-2 RNA concentrations ranged from 648.1(±514.6) copies/mL to 1441.0(±1977.8) copies/mL. Among the parameters assessed using the ANFIS model, ammonia and pH showed significant association with the concentration of SARS-CoV-2 RNA measured. Increasing ammonia concentration was associated with increasing viral RNA concentration and pH between 7.1 and 7.4 were associated with the highest SARS-CoV-2 concentration. Other parameters, such as total solids, were also observed to influence the viral RNA concentration, however, this observation was not consistent across all the wastewater treatment plants. The results from this study indicate the importance of incorporating wastewater characteristic assessment into wastewater-based epidemiology for a robust and accurate COVID-19 surveillance.;ID: 272394;;;;;;;;;;;0013-9351;;;;;;;;;https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0013935121011713;https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0013935121011713;https://doi.org/10.1016/j.envres.2021.111877;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;

As a result, driving activity was also significantly affected. Still, to-date, a quantitative assessment of the effect of COVID-19 on driving behavior during the lockdown is yet to be provided. This gap forms the motivation for this paper, which aims at comparing observed values concerning three indicators (average speed, speeding, and harsh braking), with forecasts based on their corresponding observations before the lockdown in Greece. Method: Time series of the three indicators were extracted using a specially developed smartphone application and transmitted to a back-end platform between 01/01/2020 and 09/05/2020, a time period containing normal operations, COVID-19 spreading, and the full lockdown period in Greece. Based on the collected data, XGBoost was employed to identify the most influential COVID-19 indicators, and Seasonal AutoRegressive Integrated Moving Average (SARIMA) models were developed for obtaining forecasts on driving behavior. Results: Results revealed the intensity of the impact of COVID-19 on driving, especially on average speed, speeding, and harsh braking per 100 km. More specifically, speeds were found to increase by 2.27 km/h on average compared to the forecasted evolution, while harsh braking/100 km increased to almost 1.51 on average. On the bright side, road crashes in Greece were reduced by 49% during the months of COVID-19 compared to the non-COVID-19 period.";ID: 271707;;;;;;;;;;;0022-4375;;;;;;;;;https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0022437521000542;https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0022437521000542;https://doi.org/10.1016/j.jsr.2021.04.007;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;

The World Health Organization (WHO) has declared the spread of the virus to be a global pandemic. Currently, there are over 1 million cases and over 100,000 confirmed deaths due to the virus. Hence, prophylactic and therapeutic strategies are promptly needed. In this study we report an epitope, ITLCFTLKR, which is biochemically fit to HLA allelic proteins. We propose that this could be used as a potential vaccine candidate against SARS-COV-2. A selected putative epitope and HLA-allelic complexes show not only better binding scores, but also RMSD values in the range of 0–1 Å. This epitope was found to have a 99.8% structural favorability as per Ramachandran-plot analysis. Similarly, a suitable range of IC50 values and population coverage was obtained to represent greater validation of T-cell epitope analysis. Stability analysis using MDWeb and half-life analysis using the ProtParam tool has confirmed that this epitope is well-selected.

The contagion became pandemic in few months forcing many Countries to declare lockdown status. In this context of quarantine, all commercial and productive activities are suspended, and many Countries are experiencing a serious crisis. To this aim, the understanding of risk of contagion in every urban district is fundamental for governments and administrations to establish reopening strategies. This paper proposes the calibration of an index able to predict the risk of contagion in urban districts in order to support the administrations in identifying the best strategies to reduce or restart the local activities during lockdown conditions. The objective regards the achievement of a useful tool to predict the risk of contagion by considering socio-economic data such as the presence of activities, companies, institutions and number of infections in urban districts. The proposed index is based on a factorial formula, simple and easy to be applied by practitioners, calibrated by using an optimization-based procedure and exploiting data of 257 urban districts of Apulian region (Italy). Moreover, a comparison with a more refined analysis, based on the training of Artificial Neural Networks, is performed in order to take into account the non-linearity of the phenomenon. The investigation quantifies the influence of each considered parameter in the risk of contagion useful to obtain risk analysis and forecast scenarios.;ID: 271730;;;;;;;;;;;0925-7535;;;;;;;;;https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0925753520302599;https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0925753520302599;https://doi.org/10.1016/j.ssci.2020.104862;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;

This research explores machine learning (ML) techniques to forecast the epidemiological trend of COVID-19 in India. We used 22ML algorithms develop forecasting models and selected the four best ones on the basis of their performance using mean absolute percentage error (MAPE). Feature extraction and feature selection techniques were also employed to improve performance with cumulative and daily data obtained from Mar. 2 to Apr. 25, 2020. Because of the linear nature of cumulative data, the model built with these time series data outperforms with an MAPE of 0.498, 0.240, and 0.430, respectively, for cases that are confirmed or recovered and deaths using the extra tree regressor compared with the model built with daily data with an MAPE of 1.377, 1.302, and 0.488, respectively. Moreover, the study confirms that the models perform well at the validation stage with an MAPE of 4.123, 5.411, and 4.553, respectively, for confirmed or recovered cases and deaths using a model built with cumulative data and an MAPE of 6.261, 7.576, and 6.273, respectively, using a model built with daily data. On the basis of selected models, a 15-day forecast for confirmed and recovered cases and deaths from COVID-19 was performed that can be validated in the near future. However, it depends on precaution measures taken by the central and state governments as well as individuals, including social distancing, self-isolation from society, restrictions in bus, rail, and air transport, school, college, and market closings or openings, the extension of the lockdown period, privileges to be given during lockdown, and other measures, as well whether guidelines issued by government from time to time were followed.;ID: 779963;;"Kose,Utku;Gupta,Deepak;de Albuquerque, Victor Hugo C.;Khanna,Ashish";Data Science for COVID-19;;Academic Press;;;;;;9,78013E+12;;;;;;;;;https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/B9780128245361000307;https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/B9780128245361000307;https://doi.org/10.1016/B978-0-12-824536-1.00030-7;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;

The COVID-19 epidemic started to gain traction in France in March 2020. Subnational hospital admissions and deaths were then recorded daily and served as the main policy indicators. Concurrently, mobile phone positioning data have been curated to determine the frequency of users being colocalized within a given distance. Contrarily to individual tracking data, these can be a proxy for human contact networks between subnational administrative units. Methods  Motivated by numerous studies correlating human mobility data and disease incidence, we developed predictive time series models of hospital incidence between July 2020 and April 2021. We added human contact network analytics, such as clustering coefficients, contact network strength, null links or curvature, as regressors. Findings  We found that predictions can be improved substantially (by more than 50%) at both the national level and the subnational level for up to 2 weeks. Our subnational analysis also revealed the importance of spatial structure, as incidence in colocalized administrative units improved predictions.

Rank correlation tests and a neural network named self-organising map (SOM) were used to investigate similarities in the dynamics of the disease in the cities and check possible relationships among the variables. Two periods were analysed (quarantine and post-quarantine) for all cities together and individually. The data were classified in seven groups based on city, date and biome using SOM. The virus transmission was most affected by mobility variables, especially in the post-quarantine. The meteorological variables presented different behaviours on the virus transmission in different biogeographical regions. The wind speed was one of the factors connected with the highest contamination rate recorded in Leticia. The highest new daily cases were recorded in Bogota where cold/dry conditions (average temperature 9 g/m3) favoured the contagions. In contrast, Barranquilla, Cartagena and Leticia presented an opposite trend, especially with the absolute humidity >22 g/m3.

However, the performance of traditional methods adopting in Hong Kong influenza forecasting is limited due to its particularity.

The novelties of our approach mainly include: firstly, we adopt a model for Google search queries data collection and selection in Hong Kong to substitute Google Correlate. Secondly, we adopt the stacked autoencoder (SAE) to reduce the dimensionality of Google search queries data. Thirdly, we adopt a signal decomposition method named variational mode decomposition (VMD) to decompose the influenza data into modes with different frequencies, which can extract the characteristic. Fourthly, we use artificial neural networks (ANN) to forecast these modes of influenza epidemics extracted by VMD respectively, then these forecasts of each mode are added to generate the final forecasting results. From the perspective of forecasting accuracy and hypothesis tests, the empirical results show that our proposed integrated approach SAE-VMD-ANN significantly outperforms some other benchmark models both in the whole period and influenza season.

The great advantage of the present method is the fast prediction of the analyzed property, in the present case, thermal degradation curves, at heating rates not experimentally tested. In this study, a modified activator from sugarcane bagasse was incorporated in different concentrations in natural rubber compounds, and the degradation behavior was simulated by ANN and SRM based on the experimental thermal degradation curves at different heating rates from the thermogravimetric analysis.

By mid-July 2020, reported cases exceeded 13 million worldwide, with at least 575,000 deaths and 7.33 million people recovered. In Oman, over 61,200 confirmed cases have been reported with an infection rate of 1.3. Spatial modeling of disease transmission is important to guide the response to the epidemic at the subnational level. Sociodemographic and healthcare factors such as age structure, population density, long-term illness, hospital beds and nurse practitioners can be used to explain and predict the spatial transmission of COVID-19. Therefore, this research aimed to examine whether the relationships between the incidence rates and these covariates vary spatially across Oman. Global Ordinary Least Squares (OLS), spatial lag and spatial error regression models (SLM, SEM), as well as two distinct local regression models (Geographically Weighted Regression (GWR) and multiscale geographically weighted regression MGWR), were applied to explore the spatially non-stationary relationships. As the relationships between these covariates and COVID-19 incidence rates vary geographically, the local models were able to express the non-stationary relationships among variables. Furthermore, among the eleven selected regressors, elderly population aged 65 and above, population density, hospital beds, and diabetes rates were found to be statistically significant determinants of COVID-19 incidence rates. In conclusion, spatial information derived from this modeling provides valuable insights regarding the spatially varying relationship of COVID-19 infection with these possible drivers to help establish preventative measures to reduce the community incidence rate.;ID: 280276;;;;;;;;;;;2210-6707;;;;;;;;;https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S2210670720308441;https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S2210670720308441;https://doi.org/10.1016/j.scs.2020.102627;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;

However, due to the limitations of traditional model-driven methods and data-driven methods, production forecasting is still challenging. In this paper, we propose a novel framework using Bidirectional Gated Recurrent Unit (Bi-GRU) and Sparrow Search Algorithm (SSA) that improves the accuracy of oil rate forecasting. The Bi-GRU could make full use of both past and future information inside production sequences and related features. SSA is employed for hyperparameter tuning of the Bi-GRU model. To validate the feasibility, robustness and efficiency of the proposed method, three cases are carried out from the perspective of an ideal single well from the simulation model, an actual single well under variable production constraints and actual multiple wells. Model performance is compared with traditional decline curve analysis, conventional time series methods and one-way recurrent neural networks. The observations show that the proposed method performs better than the others in terms of accuracy and robustness.;ID: 271812;;;;;;;;;;;0920-4105;;;;;;;;;https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0920410521009621;https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0920410521009621;https://doi.org/10.1016/j.petrol.2021.109309;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;

Valid near-term projections of cases are required to inform the escalation, maintenance and de-escalation of public health measures, and for short-term health care resource planning. Methods Near-term case and epidemic growth rate projections for Canada were estimated using three phenomenological models: the logistic model, Generalized Richard’s model (GRM) and a modified Incidence Decay and Exponential Adjustment (m-IDEA) model. Throughout the COVID-19 epidemic in Canada, these models have been validated against official national epidemiological data on an ongoing basis. Results The best-fit models estimated that the number of COVID-19 cases predicted to be reported in Canada as of April 1, 2020 and May 1, 2020 would be 11,156 (90 % prediction interval: 9,156−13,905) and 54,745 (90 % prediction interval: 54,252−55,239). The three models varied in their projections and their performance over the first seven weeks of their implementation. Both the logistic model and GRM under-predicted cases reported a week following the projection date in nearly all instances. The logistic model performed best at the early stages, the m-IDEA model performed best at the later stages, and the GRM performed most consistently during the full period assessed. Conclusions All three models have yielded qualitatively comparable near-term forecasts of cases and epidemic growth for Canada. Under or over-estimation of projected cases and epidemic growth by these models could be associated with changes in testing policies and/or public health measures. Simple forecasting models can be invaluable in projecting the changes in trajectory of subsequent waves of cases to provide timely information to support the pandemic response.;ID: 277421;;;;;;;;;;;1755-4365;;;;;;;;;https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S1755436521000177;https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S1755436521000177;https://doi.org/10.1016/j.epidem.2021.100457;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;

This is especially relevant for products with a short shelf life due to the potential disposal of unsold items. Horticultural products are highly influenced by this, however with limited attention in forecasting research so far. Beyond that, many forecasting competitions show a competitive performance of classical forecasting methods. For the first time, we empirically compared the performance of nine state-of-the-art machine learning and three classical forecasting algorithms for horticultural sales predictions. We show that machine learning methods were superior in all our experiments, with the gradient boosted ensemble learner XGBoost being the top performer in 14 out of 15 comparisons. This advantage over classical forecasting approaches increased for datasets with multiple seasons. Further, we show that including additional external factors, such as weather and holiday information, as well as meta-features led to a boost in predictive performance. In addition, we investigated whether the algorithms can capture the sudden increase in demand of horticultural products during the SARS-CoV-2 pandemic in 2020. For this special case, XGBoost was also superior.

The relevant study claims that due to the imposition of lockdown during COVID-19 pandemic, the atmospheric pollution level has been significantly reduced over the metropolitan city Kolkata like other cities of the world. The main objective of this study is to predict the concentration of PM2.5 using multiple linear regression (MLR) and artificial neural network (ANN) models and similarly, to compare the accuracy level of two models. The concentration of PM2.5 data has been obtained from state pollution control board, Govt. of West Bengal and daily meteorological data have been collected from the world weather website. The results show that non-linear artificial neural network model is more rational compared with multiple linear regression model due to its high precision and accuracy level (in respect to RMSE, MAE and R2). In this research artificial neural network (ANN) model exhibited higher accuracy during the training and testing phases (root mean square error (RMSE), mean absolute error (MAE) and R2 indicate 3.74, 1.14 and 0.91 respectively in training phase and 2.55, 4.32 and 0.69 in testing phase respectively).

We adopt heterogeneous autoregressive (HAR) time series models and discuss the statistical inference for various COVID-19 data. Seven data sets such as cumulative confirmed (CC) case, cumulative recovered (CR) case and cumulative death (CD) case as well as recovery rate, fatality rate and infection rates for 14 and 21 days are handled for the statistical analysis. In the HAR models, model selections of orders are conducted by evaluating root mean square error (RMSE) and mean absolute error (MAE) as well as R2, AIC, and BIC. As a result of estimation, we provide coefficients estimates, standard errors and 95% confidence intervals in the HAR models. Our results report that fitted values via the HAR models are not only well-matched with the real cumulative cases but also differenced values from the fitted HAR models are well-matched with real daily cases. Additionally, because the CC and the CD cases are strongly correlated, we use a bivariate HAR model for the two data sets. Out-of-sample forecastings are carried out with the COVID-19 data sets to obtain multi-step ahead predicted values and 95% prediction intervals. As for the forecasting performances, four accuracy measures such as RMSE, MAE, mean absolute percentage error (MAPE) and root relative square error (RRSE) are evaluated. Contributions of this work are three folds: First, it is shown that the HAR models fit well to cumulative numbers of the COVID-19 data along with good criterion results. Second, a variety of analysis are studied for the COVID-19 series: confirmed, recovered, death cases, as well as the related rates. Third, forecast accuracy measures are evaluated as small values of errors, and thus it is concluded that the HAR model provides a good prediction model for the COVID-19.;ID: 280687;;;;;;;;;;;2211-3797;;;;;;;;;https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S2211379721007233;https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S2211379721007233;https://doi.org/10.1016/j.rinp.2021.104631;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;

Since then, many countries have experienced the rapid transmission of this respiratory disease among their populations and have exercised many strategies to mitigate the spread of this disease. The prediction of the transmission dynamics serves important roles in designing mitigation strategies. However, due to the unknown characteristics of this disease, as well as the geographical and political factors, building efficient models of the dynamics for many countries is difficult. The objective of this study is to develop a transmission dynamics predictor that takes advantage of the time differences among many countries with respect to transmission of this disease, in that some countries experienced earlier outbreaks than others. The primary novelty of the proposed method is that, unlike many existing transmission predictors that require parameters based on prior knowledge of the epidemiology of past viruses, the proposed method only requires the transmission similarities between countries in the publicly available data for this current disease.

Governed by emission characteristics and meteorological conditions, the formation and destruction of fine particulate matter (PM2.5) and ozone (O3) are complicated, and accurate predictions of the concentrations of these two major secondary atmospheric pollutants remain challenging. In this study, by combining meteorological and air pollutant data from ground observations and the Weather Research and Forecasting (WRF)-Community Multiscale Air Quality (CMAQ) model simulations, a deep learning model structure based on long short-term memory layers (LSTM) was developed and applied to predict the PM2.5 and O3 concentrations in the future 48 h period. The forecasting improvement was extended to the whole Greater Bay Area by introducing a spatial correction (SC) method to the CMAQ simulation results.

The incidence time series of top ten corona infected countries are erratic and sparse. But in comparison, the incidence and disease fitness relationships are uniform and concave upward in nature.

Because the epidemic started later in Turkey than other European countries, it has the least number of deaths according to the current data. Outbreak management in COVID-19 is of great importance for public safety and public health. For this reason, prediction models can decide the precautionary warning to control the spread of the disease. Therefore, this study aims to develop a forecasting model, considering statistical data for Turkey. Box-Jenkins Methods (ARIMA), Brown’s Exponential Smoothing model and RNN-LSTM are employed. ARIMA was selected with the lowest AIC values (12.0342, -2.51411, 12.0253, 3.67729, -4.24405, and 3.66077) as the best fit for the number of total case, the growth rate of total cases, the number of new cases, the number of total death, the growth rate of total deaths and the number of new deaths, respectively. The forecast values of the number of each indicator are stable over time. In the near future, it will not show an increasing trend in the number of cases for Turkey. In addition, the pandemic will become a steady state and an increase in mortality rates will not be expected between 17–31 May. ARIMA models can be used in fresh outbreak situations to ensure health and safety.

To investigate whether this pandemic also influences crime, the differences of crime incidents numbers before and during the pandemic in four large cities (namely Washington DC, Chicago, New York City and Los Angeles) are investigated. Moreover, the Granger causal relationships between crime incidents numbers and new cases of COVID-19 are also examined. Based on that, new cases of COVID-19 with significant Granger causal correlations are used to improve the crime prediction performance. The results show that crime is generally impacted by the COVID-19 pandemic, but it varies in different cities and with different crime types. Most types of crimes have seen fewer incidents numbers during the pandemic than before. Several Granger causal correlations are found between the COVID-19 cases and crime incidents in these cities. More specifically, crime incidents numbers of theft in DC, Chicago and New York City, fraud in DC and Los Angeles, assault in Chicago and New York City, and robbery in Los Angeles and New York City, are significantly Granger caused by the new case of COVID-19. These results may be partially explained by the Routine Activity theory and Opportunity theory that people may prefer to stay at home to avoid being infected with COVID-19 during the pandemic, giving fewer chances for crimes. In addition, involving new cases of COVID-19 as a variable can slightly improve the performance of crime prediction in terms of some specific types of crime.

Methods We performed a cross-sectional study from 37 geographically diverse US children's hospitals. We included ED encounters between January 1, 2010 and December 31, 2020, transformed into time-series data. We constructed ensemble forecasting models of the most common presenting diagnoses and the most common diagnoses leading to admission, using data from 2010 through 2019. We then compared the most common presenting diagnoses and the most common diagnoses leading to admission in 2020 to the forecasts. Results 29,787,815 encounters were included, of which 1,913,085 (6.4%) occurred during 2020. ED encounters during 2020 were lower compared to prior years, with a 65.1% decrease in April relative to 2010–2019. In forecasting models, encounters for depression and diabetic ketoacidosis remained within the 95% confidence interval [CI]; fever, bronchiolitis, hyperbilirubinemia, skin/subcutaneous infections and seizures occurred within the 80–95% CI during the portions of 2020, and all other diagnoses (abdominal pain, otitis media, asthma, pneumonia, trauma, upper respiratory tract infections, and urinary tract infections) occurred below the predicted 95% CI. Conclusion Pediatric ED utilization has remained low following the COVID-19 pandemic, and below forecasted utilization for most diagnoses.

We first inhale and then produce speech while exhaling. When we run out of breath, we stop speaking and inhale. Though this process is involuntary, speech production involves a systematic outflow of air during exhalation characterized by linguistic content and prosodic factors of the utterance. Thus speech and respiration are closely related, and modeling this relationship makes sensing respiratory dynamics directly from the speech plausible, however is not well explored. In this article, we conduct a comprehensive study to explore techniques for sensing breathing signal and breathing parameters from speech using deep learning architectures and address the challenges involved in establishing the practical purpose of this technology. Estimating the breathing pattern from the speech would give us information about the respiratory parameters, thus enabling us to understand the respiratory health using one’s speech.;ID: 271125;;;;;;;;;;;0893-6080;;;;;;;;;https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0893608021001179;https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0893608021001179;https://doi.org/10.1016/j.neunet.2021.03.029;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;

To develop proper responses, not only are more accurate disease spread models needed, but also those that are easy to use. Materials and methods As of July 1, 2020, we selected the 20 countries with the highest numbers of COVID-19 cases in the world. Using the Verhulst–Pearl logistic function formula, we calculated estimates for the total number of cases for each country. We compared these estimates to the actual figures given by the WHO on the same dates. Finally, the formula was tested for longer-term reliability at t = 18 and t = 40 weeks. Results The Verhulst–Pearl logistic function formula estimated the actual numbers precisely, with only a 0.5% discrepancy on average for the first month. For all countries in the study and the world at large, the estimates for the 40th week were usually overestimated, although the estimates for some countries were still relatively close to the actual numbers in the forecasting long term. The estimated number for the world in general was about 8 times that actually observed for the long term. Conclusions The Verhulst–Pearl equation has the advantage of being very straightforward and applicable in clinical use for predicting the demand on hospitals in the short term of 4–6 weeks, which is usually enough time to reschedule elective procedures and free beds for new waves of the pandemic patients.;ID: 283376;;;;;;;;;;;2213-3984;;;;;;;;;https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S2213398421001615;https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S2213398421001615;https://doi.org/10.1016/j.cegh.2021.100853;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;

Only by understanding it more profoundly and comprehensively can it be soundly defeated. This paper is dedicated to studying the spatial-temporal characteristics of the epidemic development at the provincial-level in mainland China and the civic-level in Hubei Province. Moreover, a correlation analysis on the possible factors that cause the spatial differences in the epidemic's degree is conducted. After completing these works, three different methods are adopted to fit the daily-change tendencies of the number of confirmed cases in mainland China and Hubei Province. The three methods are the Logical Growth Model (LGM), Polynomial fitting, and Fully Connected Neural Network (FCNN). The analysis results on the spatial-temporal differences and their influencing factors show that: (1) The Chinese government has contained the domestic epidemic in early March 2020, indicating that the number of newly diagnosed cases has almost zero increase since then. (2) Throughout the entire mainland of China, effective manual intervention measures such as community isolation and urban isolation have significantly weakened the influence of the subconscious factors that may impact the spatial differences of the epidemic. (3) The classification results based on the number of confirmed cases also prove the effectiveness of the isolation measures adopted by the governments at all levels in China from another aspect. It is reflected in the small monthly grade changes (even no change) in the provinces of mainland China and the cities in Hubei Province during the study period. Based on the experimental results of curve-fitting and considering the time cost and goodness of fit comprehensively, the Polynomial(Degree=18) model is recommended in this paper for fitting the daily-change tendency of the number of confirmed cases.;ID: 276831;;;;;;;;;;;0957-5820;;;;;;;;;https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0957582021002949;https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0957582021002949;https://doi.org/10.1016/j.psep.2021.06.004;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;

It is hypothesized that a sharp decrease in the emitted amounts of particulate matter (PM10), CO, NO2 and SO2 during COVID-19 pandemic will be obtained, this corresponds with the reduced traffic due to mandated business closures. To achieve this exploration a paired sample t-test is used to compare the concentration of these four pollutants in the three cities over the period from 15 March to 30 June during the years from 2016 to 2020. It is found that there is a significant difference between the emitted concentrations mean values of CO, PM10, SO2 and NO2 during the period of study. This was indicated by the values of p for each species, which was less than 5 % for all these pollutants. The maximum reduction in SO2 and NO2 concentration during the lockdown period was in Zarqa. Irbid city witnessed the highest percentage reduction in CO and PM10. Furthermore, the correlation test, independent variable importance of multilayer perceptron and global sensitivity analysis using Sobol analysis showed that metrological data (Humidity, wind speed, average temperature and pressure) have a direct relationship with concentrations of CO, PM10, SO2 and NO2 in Amman, Irbid and Zarqa before and after COVID-19 pandemic.;ID: 272394;;;;;;;;;;;0013-9351;;;;;;;;;https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0013935121010367;https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0013935121010367;https://doi.org/10.1016/j.envres.2021.111742;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;

Surveying and predicting the electricity production (EP) is a valuable factor in the hands of electricity industry managers to make strategic decisions, especially if electricity is generated by renewable resources for environmental considerations. However, because the EP series is non-stationary and nonlinear, traditional methods are less robust to predict it. In this study, we offer a hybrid model which combines adaptive wavelet transform (AWT), long short-term memory (LSTM) and random forest (RF) algorithm (AWT-LSTM-RF) to predict the EP in hydroelectric power plant. We also apply the exogenous affecting variables on EP in the structure of hybrid model, which were selected by ant colony optimization (ACO) algorithm. To evaluate the predictive power of the AWT-LSTM-RF model, we compared its predictive results with the benchmark models including RF, ARIMA-GARCH, wavelet transform-feed forward neural network (WT-FFNN), wavelet transform-random forest (WT-RF), wavelet transform-LSTM (WT-LSTM), and WT-FFNN-RF. The empirical results indicate that the hybrid model of AWT-LSTM-RF outperforms the benchmark models.

We apply this model to investigate the effects of various transportation networks on the heterogeneous propagation of COVID-19 in China. We further apply it to predict the development of COVID-19 in China in two scenarios, i.e., i) assuming that different types of traffic restriction policies are conducted and ii) assuming that the epicenter of the COVID-19 outbreak is in Beijing, so as to illustrate the potential usage of the model in generating various policy insights to help the containment of the further spread of COVID-19. We find that the most effective way to prevent the coronavirus from spreading quickly and extensively is to control the routes linked to the epicenter at the beginning of the pandemic. But if the virus has been widely spread, setting restrictions on hub cities would be much more efficient than imposing the same travel ban across the whole country.

Retirement curves are used to predict the future aircraft fleet composition, as an element of air traffic and emissions forecasts. Furthermore, retirement curves are a tool for aircraft manufacturers and leasing companies to estimate the need for replacement aircraft as part of global aircraft demand. We have applied a methodology involving neural networks, previously being used in the area of predictive maintenance. Transferring this method of data analysis to a new research field goes beyond previously applied methodologies, as neural networks are known for finding connections in data that cannot be explicated with other methodologies. In the context of retirement curves, neural networks can help to explain the influence of economic factors or general market development on aircraft retirement. We implement a neural network to calculate survival probabilities of aircraft and estimate the impact of economic framework data on survival probabilities. The neural network uses the global passenger aircraft fleet as training data base and predicts survival probabilities which then are arranged into retirement curves. We then compare the results to other retirement curve prediction methods.

Present study analyzes a total of 332 SARS-CoV-2 genome sequences from 114 asymptomatic and 218 deceased patients from twenty-one different countries to assess the mutation profile therein in order to establish the correlation between the clinical status and the observed mutations. Methods The mining of mutations was carried out using the GISAID CoVSurver (www.gisaid.org/epiflu-applications/covsurver-mutations-app) with the reference sequence ‘hCoV-19/Wuhan/WIV04/2019’ present in NCBI with Accession number NC-045512.2. The impact of the mutations on SARS-CoV-2 proteins mutation was predicted using PredictSNP1(loschmidt.chemi.muni.cz/predictsnp1) which is a meta-server integrating six predictor tools: SIFT, PhD-SNP, PolyPhen-1, PolyPhen-2, MAPP and SNAP. The iStable integrated server (predictor.nchu.edu.tw/iStable) was used to predict shifts in the protein stability due to mutations. Results A total of 372 variants were observed in the 332 SARS-CoV-2 sequences with several variants present in multiple patients accounting for a total of 1596 incidences. Asymptomatic and deceased specific mutants constituted 32% and 62% of the repertoire respectively indicating their partial exclusivity. However, the most prevalent mutations were those present in both. Though some parts of the genome are more variable than others but there was clear difference between incidence and prevalence. Non-structural protein 3 (NSP3) with 68 variants had a total of only 105 incidences whereas Spike protein had 346 incidences with just 66 variants. Amongst the Deleterious variants, NSP3 had the highest incidence of 25 followed by NSP2 (16), ORF3a (14) and N (14). Spike protein had just 7 Deleterious variants out of 66. Conclusion Deceased patients have more Deleterious than Neutral variants as compared to the asymptomatic ones. Further, it appears that the Deleterious variants which decrease protein stability are more significant in pathogenicity of SARS-CoV-2.;ID: 271315;;;;;;;;;;;0009-2797;;;;;;;;;https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0009279721002362;https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0009279721002362;https://doi.org/10.1016/j.cbi.2021.109598;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;

The novel coronavirus disease, COVID-19, is spreading rapidly all over the world. The countries with dense populations, in particular, such as India, await imminent risk in tackling the epidemic. Different forecasting models are being used to predict future cases of COVID-19. The predicament for most of them is that they are not able to capture both the linear and nonlinear features of the data solely. Methods We propose an ensemble model integrating an autoregressive integrated moving average model (ARIMA) and a nonlinear autoregressive neural network (NAR). ARIMA models are used to extract the linear correlations and the NAR neural network for modeling the residuals of ARIMA containing nonlinear components of the data. Comparison: Single ARIMA model, ARIMA-NAR model and few other existing models which have been applied on the COVID-19 data in different countries are compared based on performance evaluation parameters. Result The hybrid combination displayed significant reduction in RMSE (16.23%), MAE (37.89%) and MAPE (39.53%) values when compared with single ARIMA model for daily observed cases. Similar results with reduced error percentages were found for daily reported deaths and cases of recovery as well. RMSE value of our hybrid model was lesser in comparison to other models used for forecasting COVID-19 in different countries.

At first are used univariate time series models in order to predict the evolution of the reported cases. Moreover, are considered combinations of the models in order to provide more accurate and robust results. Additionally, statistical probability distributions are considered in order to generate future scenarios. Final step is the build and use of an epidemiological model (tSIR) and the calculation of an epidemiological ratio (R0) for estimating the termination of the outbreak. The time series models include Exponential Smoothing and ARIMA approaches from the classical models, also Feed-Forward Artificial Neural Networks and Multivariate Adaptive Regression Splines from the machine learning toolbox. Combinations include simple mean, Newbolt-Granger and Bates-Granger approaches. Finally, the tSIR model and the R0 ratio are used for estimating the spread and the reversion of the pandemic.

First, as traditional epidemical models use the accumulative confirmed cases for training, it can only predict a rising trend of the epidemic and cannot predict when the epidemic will decline or end, an improved model is built based on long short-term memory (LSTM) with daily confirmed cases training set. Second, considering the existing forecasting model based on LSTM can only predict the epidemic trend within the next 30 days accurately, the rolling update mechanism is embedded with LSTM for long-term projections. Third, by introducing Diffusion Index (DI), the effectiveness of preventive measures like social isolation and lockdown on the spread of COVID-19 is analyzed in our novel research. The trends of the epidemic in 150 days ahead are modeled for Russia, Peru and Iran, three countries on different continents. Under our estimation, the current epidemic in Peru is predicted to continue until November 2020. The number of positive cases per day in Iran is expected to fall below 1000 by mid-November, with a gradual downward trend expected after several smaller peaks from July to September, while there will still be more than 2000 increase by early December in Russia. Moreover, our study highlights the importance of preventive measures which have been taken by the government, which shows that the strict controlment can significantly reduce the spread of COVID-19.;ID: 271591;;;;;;;;;;;0960-0779;;;;;;;;;https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S096007792030610X;https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S096007792030610X;https://doi.org/10.1016/j.chaos.2020.110214;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;

It has posed a significant challenge for the global economies, especially the healthcare sector. Even with a robust healthcare system, countries were not prepared for the ramifications of COVID-19. Several statistical, dynamic, and mathematical models of the COVID-19 outbreak including the SEIR model have been developed to analyze the infection its transmission dynamics. The objective of this research is to use public data to study the properties associated with the COVID-19 pandemic to develop a dynamic hybrid model based on SEIRD and ascertainment rate with automatically selected parameters. The proposed model consists of two parts: the modified SEIRD dynamic model and ARIMA models. We fit SEIRD model parameters against historical values of infected, recovered and deceased population divided by ascertainment rate, which, in turn, is also a parameter of the model. Residuals of the first model for infected, recovered, and deceased populations are then corrected using ARIMA models. The model can analyze the input data in real-time and provide long- and short-term forecasts with confidence intervals. The model was tested and validated on the US COVID statistics dataset from the COVID Tracking Project. For validation, we use unseen recent statistical data. We use five common measures to estimate model prediction ability: MAE, MSE, MLSE, Normalized MAE, and Normalized MSE. We proved a great model ability to make accurate predictions of infected, recovered, and deceased patients. The output of the model can be used by the government, private sectors, and policymakers to reduce health and economic risks signiﬁcantly improved consumer credit scoring.;ID: 314108;;;;;;;;;;;2468-0427;;;;;;;;;https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S2468042720301032;https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S2468042720301032;https://doi.org/10.1016/j.idm.2020.11.007;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;

Unsurprisingly, we find that prediction quality varies across economists and we reject the hypothesis of equal predictive ability. In an error decomposition, we find evidence of significantly biased forecasts. Participation rate in the survey is affecting this bias. We find that survey participants under-predict job losses in times of market turmoil while also under-predicting the recovery thereafter, especially during the COVID19 labor shock. For prediction of NFP changes, autoregressive models are outperformed by a deep learning long short-term memory network. However, the consensus forecast yields better forecasts than model-based approaches and are further improved by combining the forecasts of the best performing economists. The COVID19 labor shock is shown to have adverse effects on the prediction performance of economists.

Corona virus, also known as COVID-19 was first originated in Wuhan, Hubei province in China around December 2019 and spread out all over the world within few weeks. Based on the public datasets provided by John Hopkins university and Canadian health authority, we have developed a forecasting model of COVID-19 outbreak in Canada using state-of-the-art Deep Learning (DL) models. In this novel research, we evaluated the key features to predict the trends and possible stopping time of the current COVID-19 outbreak in Canada and around the world. In this paper we presented the Long short-term memory (LSTM) networks, a deep learning approach to forecast the future COVID-19 cases. Based on the results of our Long short-term memory (LSTM) network, we predicted the possible ending point of this outbreak will be around June 2020. In addition to that, we compared transmission rates of Canada with Italy and USA. Here we also presented the 2, 4, 6, 8, 10, 12 and 14th day predictions for 2 successive days.

The chosen time period contained normal operations, as well as the period of the first COVID-19-induced lockdown period in Greece. Three different Seasonal Autoregressive Integrated Moving Average (SARIMA) time series models were implemented in order to compare the observed measurements to forecasted values that were intended to depict assumed conditions; namely, without the appearance of the COVID-19 pandemic. Modelling results revealed that the total number of road collisions, fatalities, and slightly injured were decreased, mainly due to the sharp traffic volume decrease. However, the percentage reduction of the collision variables and traffic volume were found to be disproportionate, which probably indicates that more collisions occurred with regard to the prevailing traffic volume. An additional finding is that fatalities and slightly injured rates were significantly increased during the lockdown period and the subsequent month.

Virtual sensing technology has been applied in building energy systems to provide the more reliable and informative sensing environments. However, conventional virtual sensors still have structural and practical limitations under the physical sensor absences and limited datasets. Existing virtual sensors are separately developed by modeling multiple input variables and a single target (Xs to Y), which is the variable-level virtual sensor (VLVS); therefore, these virtual sensors cannot benefit by either using their target variable (Y) or by considering other virtual sensors when developing the models. This can result in insufficient accuracy, particularly in the limited sensors. Herein, to overcome these limitations, a novel virtual sensing framework, system-level virtual sensing (SLVS), is proposed for building energy systems using an autoencoder. Two strategies are also proposed. The autoencoder-based SLVS with the two strategies was applied in a real operational district heating system. The first strategy showed an improved accuracy using a new assistance virtual sensor, which is derived by additional information and knowledge regarding system design, control, and devices. It could also overcome the training data dependency in the limited datasets. The second strategy provided a replacement function for the SLVS specialized for backup and a calibration effect for the existing VLVS.

The results of SEM showed that perceived benefit is the key predictor of the protective behavior in Morocco, followed by self-efficacy, and then perceived severity. By contrast, ANN analysis showed that perceived severity was the most vital factor for predicting the protective behavior in Morocco, followed by perceived benefits, and then self-efficacy. For the Indian sample, both SEM analysis and the ANN model revealed that the impact of perceived susceptibility on the adoption of the protective measure is stronger than that of cues to action. Theoretical contributions and managerial implications are also discussed toward the end.;ID: 272394;;;;;;;;;;;0013-9351;;;;;;;;;https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0013935121006708;https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0013935121006708;https://doi.org/10.1016/j.envres.2021.111376;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
Journal Article;RefID:625-truong2021estimating;Truong,Dothang;Estimating the impact of COVID-19 on air travel in the medium and long term using neural network and Monte Carlo simulation;Journal of Air Transport Management;;2021;;sep-21;96;;102126;;;The COVID-19 pandemic has had a substantial impact on the airline industry. Air travel in the United States declined in 2020 with significantly lower domestic and international flights. The dynamic change and uncertainty in the trend of COVID-19 have made it difficult to predict future air travel. This paper aims at developing and testing neural network models that predict domestic and international air travel in the medium and long term based on residents' daily trips by distance, economic condition, COVID-19 severity, and travel restrictions. Data in the United States from various sources were used to train and validate the neural network models, and Monte Carlo simulations were constructed to predict air travel under uncertainty of the pandemic and economic growth. The results show that weekly economic index (WEI) is the most important predictor for air travel. Additionally, daily trips by distance play a more important role in the prediction of domestic air travel than the international one, while travel restrictions seem to have an impact on both. Sensitivity analysis results for four different scenarios indicate that air travel in the future is more sensitive to the change in WEI than the changes in COVID-19 variables. Additionally, even in the best-case scenario, when the pandemic is over and the economy is back to normal, it still takes several years for air travel to return to normal, as before the pandemic. The findings have significant contributions to the literature in COVID-19's impact on air transportation and air travel prediction.;ID: 271915;;;;;;;;;;;0969-6997;;;;;;;;;https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0969699721001083;https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0969699721001083;https://doi.org/10.1016/j.jairtraman.2021.102126;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;

The basic idea is to use a generative neural network to approximate the stochastic response. The challenge with such a framework resides in designing the network architecture and selecting loss-function suitable for a stochastic response. While we utilize a simple feed-forward neural network, we propose to use conditional maximum mean discrepancy (CMMD) as the loss function. CMMD exploits the property of reproducing kernel Hilbert space and allows capturing discrepancy between the target and the neural network predicted distributions. The proposed approach is mathematically rigorous, in the sense that it makes no assumptions about the probability density function of the response. The performance of the proposed approach is illustrated using four benchmark problems selected from the literature. Results obtained indicate the excellent performance of the proposed approach.;ID: 271449;;;;;;;;;;;0266-8920;;;;;;;;;https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0266892022000315;https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0266892022000315;https://doi.org/10.1016/j.probengmech.2022.103248;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
Journal Article;RefID:623-taylor2021combining;"Taylor,James W.;Taylor,Kathryn S.";Combining probabilistic forecasts of COVID-19 mortality in the United States;European Journal of Operational Research;Eur.J.Oper.Res.;2021;;Available online 28 June 2021;;;;;;The COVID-19 pandemic has placed forecasting models at the forefront of health policy making. Predictions of mortality, cases and hospitalisations help governments meet planning and resource allocation challenges. In this paper, we consider the weekly forecasting of the cumulative mortality due to COVID-19 at the national and state level in the U.S. Optimal decision-making requires a forecast of a probability distribution, rather than just a single point forecast. Interval forecasts are also important, as they can support decision making and provide situational awareness. We consider the case where probabilistic forecasts have been provided by multiple forecasting teams, and we combine the forecasts to extract the wisdom of the crowd. We use a dataset that has been made publicly available from the COVID-19 Forecast Hub. A notable feature of the dataset is that the availability of forecasts from participating teams varies greatly across the 40 weeks in our study. We evaluate the accuracy of combining methods that have been previously proposed for interval forecasts and predictions of probability distributions. These include the use of the simple average, the median, and trimming methods. In addition, we propose several new weighted combining methods. Our results show that, although the median was very useful for the early weeks of the pandemic, the simple average was preferable thereafter, and that, as a history of forecast accuracy accumulates, the best results can be produced by a weighted combining method that uses weights that are inversely proportional to the historical accuracy of the individual forecasting teams.;ID: 271700;;;;;;;;;;;0377-2217;;;;;;;;;https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0377221721005609;https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0377221721005609;https://doi.org/10.1016/j.ejor.2021.06.044;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
Journal Article;RefID:622-jasiński2022approach;Jasiński,Tomasz;A new approach to modeling cycles with summer and winter demand peaks as input variables for deep neural networks;Renewable and Sustainable Energy Reviews;;2022;;May 2022;159;;112217;;;Electricity demand is highly cyclical. In many markets, two demand peaks are observed – winter and summer. The paper presents a new, complex approach to modeling this type of cycles using trigonometric functions and long-term changes using the sliding window technique. The proposed method allows the modeling of annual cycles with asymmetrically located upper maxima of the demand. The new formulas take into account the moments of each peak occurrence, their values, as well as the demand course between them. All parameters can be selected in an algorithmic manner. Due to the modeling of each of the 24 h separately, it is possible to take into consideration the differences in the course of the cycles for each of them. The approach was tested in three electricity markets that differ in the demand pattern, with a different relation between values of winter and summer peaks. The precision of the proposed approach was verified by deep neural networks. They were used to forecast electricity demand for each of the 24 h of the day, one day ahead. As comparative models, deep neural networks based on lagged values of demand were used. A large test dataset out of sample forecasts covering a period of two calendar years was used. This showed that the proposed novel approach significantly reduces the mean absolute percentage error compared to the models directly forecasting total electricity demand. The described approach can also be used in forecasting techniques other than artificial neural networks.;ID: 271969;;;;;;;;;;;1364-0321;;;;;;;;;https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S136403212200140X;https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S136403212200140X;https://doi.org/10.1016/j.rser.2022.112217;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
